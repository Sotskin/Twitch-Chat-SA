Dota is a great game :)
frieza is too shy to talk in this channel because mods like banning but heres a sneak peak xxxGH :)
life is a struggle and every momeny is agony :)
@VitaBellae nice, can't wait for channel with nice mods :)
its ok sunder gets blocked by linken'S :)
these teams are really putting on a great show! regardless who wins, i hope both teams enjoy themselves and have fun in this great game we call dota :)

It's ok Sylar, it's not like you're the carry or anything. :)
just enjoy your stockholm syndrome :)
these smilies are making me go insane :)
its ok to die here you can try again next time :)
snow ball such a good skill :)
VGJ it's ok if you lose because VGJ throw first game usually only to win the other 2 :)
Good series to watch while waiting for Dreamleague :)
remember the only emotion you're allowed to express is happiness if you're feeling sad or alone, dont tell us, the mods will ban :)
VGJ with the no-stun strat :)
Im smiling but dead inside :)
better luck next tmie omni :)
Very brave of VGJ to try ambitious no stun strat. :)
at least you tried to gank :)
GA was close to saving Naix :)
I TRIED TO SAVE YOU LS :)
i like this chat its always so positive :)
It's ok to throw the first game you can just win then next 2 :)
I saved your soul LS :)
this game is enjoyable to view :)
Police states means that everyone is happy :)
cheer me up chat im sad :)
it feels so good in this chat everyone saying such positive things :)
I'm happy because of Vicodin :)
As a person with no self value every moment is torture :)
@TriHard_from_the_news thats a ban sir :)
everyone thanks the mods, for making this channel so positive :)
@yungdaf don't say that, you're hurting some people :)
OD vs TB they're good heroes :)
i just wanna suicide when i see this emote :)
It's great that this meta is so varied that and gyro every game :)
the only reason i havent kill myself yet is for the pure irony of it all :)
don't suicide friends you too can :)
It's great that this meta is so varied tb and gyro every game :)
keep the positivity in and out of the game, chat :)
thank you mods for making chat so positive nothing annoys me more when people remind me of negative emotions :)
I know I love seeing Gyro and TB game after game after game. When was the last time I saw no tusk support? Can't remember it :)
be better than god intended :)
at least they tried to rosh :)
nice try VGJ, you almost had it :)
keep trying VGJ, you can do it it! :)
it was a good start for vgj :)
It's ok you can win the next two games like you normally do :)
if they believe in themselves they can achieve anything :)
No gold penalty after buyin back :)
@spittingknowledge thats not very positive of you :)
This caster is doing his best. :)
This caster can only get better in time :)
this caster is no the best but at least he tries :)
@spittingknowledge this is bannable sir :)
vgj can watch the replay of ame after this game, no point in not learning from a loss :)
i am personally not a fan of My Little Pony, but respect the caster for being so forward with his passions :)
Caster can only get better with constructive criticism :)
this caster is australian, and I think that's okay :)
yes MLPDota is a brony, but thats okay, everyones different :)
there is no negativity here :)
everyones entitled to live a life of happiness and fulfillment, besides bronies :)
Only PMA prevails in this world :)
the mods dont realise that but they'll continue to ban anyone who doesnt express positivity :)
At least Sylar got the opportunity to become better with to practice makes perfect :)
@LaughsWithKnives I think that's something we can all agree on :)
i think ROTK did a great job drafting :)
I am sorry I offended you mr moderator :)
Thank god no Gyro game :)
At least Sylar got the opportunity to become better with tb to practice makes perfect :)
now sylar should have a feel for TB the second time he decides to play him :)
sometimes i laugh at the fact there's an unpaid moderator reading every single line of twitch chat with his ban hammer ready :)
its ok to die here they will have another chance next game :)
it was still a good attempt from VGJ :)
Isn't a Chat without trihard great? :)
its only game 1 in a best of 3, they should have time to reflect on their mistakes and make improvements in game 2, hopefully :)
as long as both teams are having a good time :)
chat full of white emote cmonBruh
This caster is doing his best, and I can appreciate that :)
@yungdaf maybe you should be more positive :)
mod we love you please dont ban people :)
thanks for the reminder moobot :)
LGD save my loading screen BlessRNG
this faux positivity is actually making me really upset, but thats okay, ill do as the mods say :)
I want to kill everyone here :)
BkopCasting its alright youre catching the importnat things :)

@VitaBellae dying is not that bad. you can still buy back :)
Im casting at 6am if I miss something sorry :)

Positivity is the power of the universe :)
I lost my job and watching dota :)
@LaughsWithKnives no he keeps a positive attitude when he does it, so thats okay :)
i still love my bitchy ex :)
i lost my friend watching dota :)
my husband hits me most weekends, but he keeps a positive attitude while he does it, so that's totally okay with me :)
