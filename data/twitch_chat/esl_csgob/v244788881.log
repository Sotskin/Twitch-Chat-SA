[0:36:54] <+roid_c> @1bSb no the players live in NA
[0:36:56] <+reaparrrrr> @Ningenchop didnt want to be in Na
[0:36:57] <lassius321> @chatten123 Check their stats on CoL's latest games on HLTV, they are usually the two top fraggers :P
[0:36:58] <faythh155> so ez money if some1 bets on col and actually wins
[0:37:00] <+otwisti> They play from NA but 3/ 5 are danish
[0:37:02] <boozy18> hc ? xD
[0:37:05] <r_Scoofy> @1bSb they live in NA and they have 2 NA players?
[0:37:06] <+hokieboy01> @vspurs flag is whatever the most players are
[0:37:11] <lassius321> They do carry col xD look at stats
[0:37:16] <+Markzehh> @Vspurs 3 danish and 2 NA, so its majority Danish
[0:37:19] <+hokieboy01> @vspurs so 3 danish players = danish flag
[0:37:22] <nico141e> optic wants good team, cant go full NA then....
[0:37:25] <Vspurs> Ah okay
[0:37:39] <Vspurs> Seems a strange way to do it, but thanks for explaining
[0:37:53] <chatten123> you need to look further back and btw its not always about top fragging, are you ten years old or something?
[0:37:54] <+masiplaya> this is so stupid from optic
[0:37:57] <MrBoogieNL> optic man jezus
[0:37:59] <+nanerpus_> A Optic considers Mirage one of their good maps
[0:38:02] <wet_dream_team> OpTic so trash
[0:38:06] <CerkazTV> They could place in EU too, but then they wouldn't get as many ez wins
[0:38:06] <+GoldClassGaming> r6rekt
[0:38:12] <%colombian_dono18> I called that optic was gonna lose
[0:38:13] <bravbrother> Gg
[0:38:15] <xrealx369> Why all this noise , just invite liquid instead of these qualifiers
[0:38:18] <la315> blyat dolboebi
[0:38:19] <boozy18> col better at mirage
[0:38:21] <+otwisti> OpTic is from Dallas and they live near the hq @vspurs
[0:38:25] <+hokieboy01> sumW optic haters wanna fight sumE
[0:38:25] <boozy18> optic best nuke map
[0:38:27] <+Diviin3_sky> shazam needs to drop a fucking m4 to konfig
[0:38:35] <+F1ourish> micoGasm
[0:38:35] <wet_dream_team> OpTic is horrible on CT on pretty much every map
[0:38:44] <lassius321> @chatten123 When did i say its all about fragging... dont make up stuff lmao. they perform consistently for col. do you get it?
[0:38:46] <+dirtEcs> !maps
[0:38:46] <Whoateallthep1es> why play retake of you can never retake
[0:38:50] <bravbrother> Who bettod optic can win 2:0 ?
[0:38:53] <+reaparrrrr> @xrealx369 ESL wouldve if you didnt have 6 Australian and Asian teams in attendance lol
[0:38:54] <nacho_cs_96> five seven in 2018 (puke)
[0:38:59] <+IAMSAM_Echelon> -shaz +ska
[0:39:00] <+reaparrrrr> *they
[0:39:01] <faythh155> I have bet on optic
[0:39:08] <faythh155> but I have small amount..
[0:39:10] <+hokieboy01> The five seven is epic
[0:39:11] <chatten123> yes and ptr dephh too so stfu now youre boring
[0:39:13] <seleni> col on fire
[0:39:14] <+Diviin3_sky> maps are Mirage Nuke and inferno
[0:39:15] <faythh155> on complexity I mean *
[0:39:25] <kfcwelfareleech> LUL WHEN U THOUGHT COL HAD A CHANCE THEY GO THROW LUL
[0:39:26] <+BmMaAaCc> optic has had like a month and a half to practice ct side not enough time imo
[0:39:37] <lassius321> but yay and android perform better than dephh :D

[0:41:35] <%colombian_dono18> This is what you get when you don't want to spend money
[0:41:46] <lassius321> their A hold and retakes arent good enough
[0:41:54] <chatten123> col are too
[0:41:55] <ganeshcg1> score?
[0:41:56] <bravbrother> Col up tier 2 soon

[0:42:24] <lassius321> online
[0:42:26] <nico141e> spent the budget on k0nfig LUL
[0:42:27] <chatten123> complexity are rising
[0:42:28] <+anikin> 5v5 retake is only really good if you know what you're doing, and optic is showing they don't
[0:42:29] <kfcwelfareleech> their ecos better than rifle rounds Kreygasm
[0:42:32] <bravbrother> Online
[0:42:34] <+Iceblade_NL> wtf coL all have 5 ping??
[0:42:45] <wet_dream_team> OpTic has had plenty of time to practice this map, and they have played it plenty. This roster just won't work

[0:44:03] <kfcwelfareleech> OG lose bo3 to complexity LuL
[0:44:06] <+ElectroTV> ur joking right?
[0:44:06] <cancerouscrab> ive only seen them on pistols this half we cant really judge them with it

[1:11:39] <+crafter_joshy> the fact that they even signed gade amazes me
[1:11:42] <tit4n99> -shazam +brax
[1:11:43] <lassius321> but on LAN OpTic would beat coL is a bo3
[1:11:45] <ShirOdotO> nuke for optic
[1:11:46] <+ntri> @Bmangames12 im not saying stan was a good pickup i think it was garbage, but he is probably a better igl over friberg since he has experience doing it
[1:11:47] <Scription12> it was nrg pick
[1:11:48] <boromontv> @bmmaaacc thx sir
[1:11:48] <+BmMaAaCc> gade good tho
[1:11:51] <+Bmangames12> @ntrI pretty sure he didnt stay cause he wanted to stay always europe and not move to the us
[1:11:55] <SwamptonCS> @BmMaAaCc optic picked nuke
[1:11:58] <+BmMaAaCc> @boromontv np my dood
[1:11:59] <lassius321> @crafter_joshy gade is on a 6 month loan only

[1:12:33] <+BmMaAaCc> nuke is optic pick
[1:12:38] <+ntri> @Bmangames12 look where he is now, im pretty sure he'd rather stay in the states just to get paid to play still rather than just have to stream
[1:12:43] <SwamptonCS> @BmMaAaCc ya they are undefeated on it xD
[1:12:43] <Vulgar1337> Who win 1 map?
