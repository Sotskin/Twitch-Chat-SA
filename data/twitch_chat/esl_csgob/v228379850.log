[5:15:21] <Joskendo> thx
[5:16:15] <+K9Unit_Renon> Kinda harsh that one of the three rounds EYG won was a round they should not have one.
[5:16:34] <+Zescht_> Yes, kinda weird
[5:16:41] <+Zescht_> But those are mistakes that are so unique
[5:16:56] <+K9Unit_Renon> Such a miracle round but no capitalization.
