[0:00:11] <msa420> ?
[0:00:12] <dfvsdvf> when does nip vs envy start
[0:00:12] <@Cent> Need to wait for the game on ESL_CSGO to end before they can stream.
[0:00:13] <bobuddha> the north remembers

[0:00:39] <Stjaertsmoer> admiralB admiralB admiralB
[0:00:53] <naxxie> Yes! This great stream again =)
[0:00:56] <bobuddha> scam dont believe it, they just dont care about eslcsgob subs
[0:01:01] <bobuddha> Kappa
[0:02:04] <+TheOnlyDroid> Well that buzzing is being just that little bit more irritating.
[0:02:04] <@Moobot> @moobot Casters are: @Blucsgo & @JamezIRL
[0:02:35] <AubreyOP> HeyGuys
[0:03:04] <willqviist> @ESL_CSGOb why has the production and quality been so bad for this event?
[0:03:04] <xhotgamerdudex> And?
[0:03:08] <ApanKevin> Guys guys
[0:03:22] <+johanl33t> tejbzLove
[0:03:29] <ApanKevin> PJSalt
[0:03:38] <Enterrity1> why me
[0:03:59] <Enterrity1> i only said a name
[0:04:31] <Cowlorier> stop delaying the fucking game all the time >.<
[0:04:31] <+knutos> Where is the stream wtf :D
[0:05:43] <DBKBloodWolf> they arent delaying the game
[0:05:44] <@Cent> Need to wait for the game on ESL_CSGO to end before they can stream the next game.
[0:05:49] <xile1> Its not their fault, NIP cant play against Envyus while they are already playing against Cloud9. Have some common sense
[0:06:52] <bobuddha> u guys need to wait the other game ends so it can give time for these techs from the 50´s to fix the lag Kappa
[0:06:57] <DBKBloodWolf> And even after it's over there will be a short break. The team needs a small breather at least. They wont just shove them straight into the server right after the match ends
[0:07:06] <dfvsdvf> when is game on?
[0:07:17] <itachiclan> 1-min
[0:07:21] <DBKBloodWolf> I would say 15-20 mins at most
[0:07:21] <ShineAnder> wait envyua vs nip
[0:07:56] <DBKBloodWolf> Envy still has to finish off C9 and then they will get a short break while everyone discusses it.
[0:08:00] <bobuddha> how can c9 just suck so much from one day to another uhhh feelsbadman
[0:08:08] <@prius> whats going on

[0:22:15] <gaffeltruck69> 23:05 i think
[0:22:23] <sparkfesk> yeah they are slow
[0:22:26] <MaBo974> start ffs!
[0:22:27] <pommacjr> lol nip already confirmed in the playoffs but a win here will sevure the first place in the group
[0:22:35] <ibmhigh> yeah
[0:22:38] <MRmobis82> nip ftw #nipmagic #goninjas
[0:22:44] <swesmile> I really hope envyus wins! Sweden forever <3
[0:22:47] <sparkfesk> @jackzybutz123 it says 22;45, which was 15min ato
[0:22:48] <crispyyyy> nip i think @pluieZ
[0:23:00] <call3z> then its a tie in the top @pluieZ
[0:23:07] <+rolltidered> lowest possible stream quality here
[0:23:08] <Stussee> SK has a point reduction for OT
[0:23:09] <pommacjr> nip will be no1 because of the round win/loss diff
[0:23:13] <+kidd1329> slop3HEY
[0:23:19] <frxdrxk> NIP MED DIP PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:23:20] <+SleepDeprived> What map for NIP vs Envy?
[0:23:20] <dankoSRB> it cant start at 45 because envy finished few mins ago
[0:23:23] <+FreshDanieldore> the other matches took longer and envy needs at least a little break
[0:23:28] <+SleepDeprived> What map is it guys?
[0:23:33] <sergiolivetg> IF NIP lose this who will pass envys or NiP?
[0:23:35] <Stussee> ez nip
[0:23:36] <crispyyyy> fl0mHear fl0mHear
[0:23:38] <Gibboverse> Unless C9 get 16-0 by SK and NiP win by only 1 rnd NiP top the group if they both win
[0:23:43] <+FreshDanieldore> thats why its starting a bit later
[0:23:44] <+SleepDeprived> If Envy lose they won't qualify I think.
[0:23:47] <sergiolivetg> Will be mirage
[0:23:47] <nicciiiii> @pluiez NIP would be first since SK has 2 overtime wins.
[0:23:53] <julfliexsweax> score Pls ?
[0:23:55] <Zezuill> If envy win they go on
[0:23:58] <Jroseen> when does the match start?
[0:24:03] <pommacjr> nip is already confirmed in the playoffs
[0:24:05] <+FLy1nRabBit> Is this Hans Zimmer?
[0:24:08] <baluzinho_> 1-0 for nip
[0:24:11] <unojuno> when they start plaing
[0:24:26] <+timisonw> VoteYea
[0:24:29] <irwit2k> Have NiP lost yet ?
[0:24:30] <Stussee> Cobble or Train most likely - my guess train but could be ccble
[0:24:30] <sergiolivetg> @OverHeatinq so SK and NiP will qualify even if they lose? NiP is 3-1 Envy 2-2 Sk is 3-1
