[0:21:03] <Tyrull> @kbags87K its a bit of a nightmare to do that mid series, don't you think?
[0:21:05] <+b1ackjelly> @Tyrull The boxes show the previous results... if its bo2 it would only be 1 box on each, as there can only have been 1 previously won map..
[0:21:05] <de_so> @storzu WOW! U are really stupid.
[0:21:14] <+kbags87K> @tyrull 1 box? yeah sooooo hard

[0:22:01] <+Titan_Adc> Listen move on about the series being best of 2 or 3 we all know it’s 3 relax boys
[0:22:02] <+kbags87K> nah it would help immensely in the case that it is ho2 which is extremely rare at LAN play
