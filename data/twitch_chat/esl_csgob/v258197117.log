[0:21:10] <jasmyn> show us some stats
[0:21:19] <samiface> are there any cs teams that have girls that arent dedicated girl teams
[0:21:20] <danorpx> *tats
[0:21:29] <iamblindmodz> No
[0:21:30] <jasmyn> nat carries hard i bet her back hurting :((
[0:21:34] <samiface> why
[0:21:44] <+MorphineBear> nice foot
[0:21:50] <Menta_> why are men and women even divided in esport?!?
[0:21:53] <jasmyn> yuCK
[0:21:59] <iamblindmodz> cuz girl suck tbh
[0:22:03] <cosw69> Excited 🤗🤗🤗
[0:22:07] <jasmyn> ^
[0:22:07] <+LokiTheElusive> the skill gap is too high @samiface @Menta_
[0:22:10] <+lukasrv> LUL
[0:22:19] <+LokiTheElusive> its perfectly allowed, but its the truth
[0:22:24] <+StreamerViews> CLG Green was a thing for a while
[0:22:34] <pusymane> forsenKek
[0:22:36] <ellioshow> I think you would see a couple of women in regular cs if women's cs didn't exist
[0:22:36] <Menta_> but why do we need an esport with less skill then
[0:22:41] <samiface> is there no argument that if they played on a normal team they'd improve faster?
[0:22:41] <danorpx> CLG green beat the real CLG LUL
[0:22:46] <Menta_> to see comp p90?
[0:22:55] <jasmyn> girls are allowed to play with male teams lamo they just too bad and need their own comps
[0:22:58] <+LokiTheElusive> because entertainment boi
[0:23:10] <pusymane> Serious question is csgo women’s and men’s segregated?
[0:23:12] <Menta_> p90 rushes goco
[0:23:21] <iamblindmodz> No
[0:23:22] <Menta_> mentaDuh mentaDuh mentaDuh
[0:23:30] <PapaBlesss69> ez for riv
[0:23:41] <Rand0m_Beef> tytöt pelaa!
[0:23:54] <konii91> @papablesss69 ez katka
[0:23:57] <pusymane> So why the whole team women or men why no mix yet? Is there a team that’s mixed?
[0:24:05] <+supchc> Separate womens league Jebaited
[0:24:25] <+LokiTheElusive> i personally havent seen a mixed team, i've seen it in Gears of War, but no other esports
[0:24:36] <samiface> team fortress 2
[0:24:37] <+LokiTheElusive> maybe allstar events?
[0:24:44] <samiface> a girl won prem on a mixed team
[0:24:48] <+tSparkles> fam r u big?
[0:24:49] <+supchc> Girls cant hang mentally and reactionarily
[0:24:49] <danorpx> No female CS pro is good enough, probably only juliano could make it
[0:24:56] <jasmyn> ^
[0:25:05] <pusymane> @supchc bruh das what I mean tho forsenKek why have a women’s league only
[0:25:23] <biobeast88> just look at all kinds of sports, there are no mixed teams in sports
[0:25:24] <PapaBlesss69> @konii91 what you gonna do with the 10k LUL
[0:25:27] <+LokiTheElusive> and there is a big risk if juliano takes it
[0:25:27] <카라멜맥주> :
[0:25:41] <DaTBoy_v2> This team is 7 players????
[0:25:44] <+LokiTheElusive> tennis @biobeast88
[0:25:52] <konii91> @papablesss69 I dunno, pay off my hecs debt LUL
[0:25:54] <Unvirginizor> There probably is a mixed team, we probably haven’t seen them since none of them have reached a good enough skill. To compete against the big boys
[0:26:03] <jasmyn> koNI
[0:26:08] <Nutterres> its cha boi
[0:26:09] <Unvirginizor> Just a theory or something idk
[0:26:12] <+supchc> Cause women are not equal in anything. Patriarchy forever
[0:26:14] <pusymane> big boys forsenGASM
[0:26:16] <biobeast88> no tennis is not mixed, somen play against somdn and mdn against men

[0:28:01] <jasmyn> when did ccc get picked up by control rofl
[0:28:02] <Skuolfi> at the risk of getting banned: nothing is preventing mixed gender teams, it's just that women for some reason aren't as good as men

[0:56:57] <konii91> @caniliveforever3 I don't really like the use of "best" , unless it's more specified like best rifler/awp/entry/support. Just way too general

[5:48:02] <+stamina_lynx> there should be no girl league they should play with the guys
[5:48:13] <K9_delta> iagree
[5:48:16] <doinsarvo> PLEASE DONT TYPE IN CHAT UNLESS YOURE AT LEAST GLOBSL ELITE
[5:48:16] <RojerVes> where is cam videos???
[5:48:17] <jooordyn> that was a nice statement thank u @DiinkyNZ
[5:48:17] <@Cent> Main Stream is the Mens match. I'm all for people wanting to watch this event. I just don't like people coming to be annoying in the Womens match zzz
[5:48:17] <jasmyn> they can
[5:48:20] <+stamina_lynx> only about equality
[5:48:21] <+shikarie02> yeah well this isn't a perfect world
[5:48:22] <sunsigncancer> go cts cuz why not
[5:48:22] <NFi_> they do play against the guys
[5:48:24] <K9_delta> but thats not how it is so unlucky
[5:48:25] <+toqqle> @stamina_lynx that would be a mess of a show
[5:48:35] <DiinkyNZ> y da hell do u guys care...
[5:48:39] <RojerVes> i cant see their face
[5:48:40] <+simon_au> @stamina_lynx There is no reason they cant play in the open league... whats ur problem with a girls league ?
[5:48:45] <+StealthSoup> @stamina_lynx they can. they just need to qualify with all the other teams. this is just a WvW league
[5:48:47] <favell_csgo> only noot noot plays against guy teams
[5:48:50] <+redsnoWAUS> why everyone gotta be so mad...
[5:48:51] <DiinkyNZ> its free money for fems + marketintg
[5:49:03] <DiinkyNZ> neck up and watch u grubs
[5:49:07] <K9_delta> i think the argument is that men dont get a men only league
[5:49:17] <sunsigncancer> i have second fragged 2 a girl before and believe me it didnot feel good
[5:49:18] <favell_csgo> well
[5:49:25] <doinsarvo> this is the most toxic chat i’ve come across in a while
[5:49:27] <DiinkyNZ> its pre much men only... holy crap
[5:49:29] <K9_delta> but \_0_/
[5:49:34] <fredorathegamer> this is a great opportunity for some lovely ladies, if you dont enjoy it then make like a tree and LEAF, we dont need ur hate in here
[5:49:35] <miss_invictus> saints have potention to play mixed
[5:49:40] <Ouida> Free money? Your eyeballs are what on a stream...
[5:49:47] <+stamina_lynx> its only men only because girls want the easy tournaments
[5:49:48] <kappawild> even semi pro players in aus dont get the same chances as gold nova females
[5:49:54] <WanderCS> The aregument is if you want a society where there is equal opportunity, then a womens only league is not the answer
[5:49:56] <+shikarie02> lol
[5:50:00] <+stamina_lynx> they dont want the challenge
[5:50:01] <jasmyn> leagues are so saturated with male teams, when females dont qualify it IS male v male??
[5:50:03] <highclassroller> never watched girls cs... is it like horse racing with donkeys?
[5:50:12] <RojerVes> girls playing worse than man
[5:50:16] <favell_csgo> technically, men are the only one who ever qualifies for even tier 4 tourneys
[5:50:17] <DiinkyNZ> nobody is stopping it from making it men only lol
[5:50:22] <+StealthSoup> @kappawild cause they dont get put on twitch?
[5:50:24] <+toqqle> any team can try out for open leagues, no matter gender, some teams are co-ed. the battle is beating a team like Astralias or c9
[5:50:28] <DiinkyNZ> its marketing go study u guys might understand
[5:50:29] <@Moobot> moobot Casters are https://twitter.com/elfishguy & https://twitter.com/brainstormcasts
[5:50:48] <favell_csgo> so it technically is male only, obviously not intentionally tho
[5:50:54] <kappawild> @StealthSoup well they do by amateur casters
[5:50:57] <jasmyn> yeahhh
[5:51:03] <K9_delta> the idea is that all teams should have togo through the same struggle, no gender should get an extra tourney
[5:51:10] <AUSSIEJACKO> riv riv riv!! luv from invex
[5:51:11] <sunsigncancer> i would have liked 2 have a girl team mates if she bottom frags and is hot
[5:51:17] <K9_delta> but i guess its betteer than having no extra tourney
[5:51:22] <favell_csgo> its just females currently play on a tier 7 level, which doesnt allow females to play important tourneys
[5:51:22] <jasmyn> if u dont like it dont watch it LUL
[5:51:35] <+toqqle> it’s “male only” because the top players in the world team up...and happen to be guys. if a girl team came and stomped an open league nothing would stop them. it’ll happen soon enough i promise
[5:51:36] <miaaa___> well said jas
[5:51:46] <+StealthSoup> @kappawild they do though. Apply for a minor tournament, work your way up. there's casters there at low low levels.
[5:51:54] <favell_csgo> i guess the main thing and purpose is to draw more females to play the game
[5:51:58] <RojerVes> vegetables gaming
[5:52:00] <sunsigncancer> @toqqle for the sake of cs go i hope not
[5:52:04] <DiinkyNZ> it will never happen
[5:52:10] <AUSSIEJACKO> yeeeeeeee sydney saints!!!
[5:52:22] <jasmyn> riv is cute omg
[5:52:22] <DiinkyNZ> dont kid urself now lad
[5:52:22] <+redsnoWAUS> yeet sydney
[5:52:26] <+toqqle> @sunsigncancer for the sake of csgo? what does girls playing have anything to do with anything? it’s a game of skill. not a boys club
[5:52:27] <favell_csgo> but its unfortunate that every team other then noot noot use these tournaments as a quick cash grab and then disband after
[5:52:32] <jooordyn> turtl #1 admin
[5:52:35] <dsv_8> they not even looks like aussies fergThinking
[5:52:45] <+redsnoWAUS> I hope they all Dab

[5:53:34] <+shikarie02> lol personal opinion
[5:53:37] <+toqqle> @sunsigncancer those “men” won’t matter, if girls playing esports stops you from watching esports then you better find another hobby.
[5:53:38] <favell_csgo> ye what you mean they dont look like aussies, its not like men, you can tell if a guy is aussie easily, its harder for girls
