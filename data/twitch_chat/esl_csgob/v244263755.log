[1:35:54] <+Der_Richi> no jamez is jamez
[1:36:03] <dr0nCSGO> @Penum It ws FPL, he is still in RankS

[1:36:07] <SubMur> Pierce "Swag" Braxton sleeping NotLikeThis
[1:36:12] <Penum> O right
[1:36:17] <act1oN> Not sure why Torqued don't ban overpass, seeing as they got spanked on it earlier
[1:36:19] <dr0nCSGO> and he got kicked cuz he is a "coach" @Penum
[1:36:19] <emre598> @noahB__ Let Tarik focus on his fragging, his performance has been dropping lately.
[1:36:20] <+coNtrl> @Penum he's rank S right now?
[1:36:21] <tufhanniwnl> @noahB__ nifty is an awper and igl, so i think if c9 gets a real igl it would be better for tarik, so he can focus on his game instead of the map or something
[1:36:23] <sorgon1> NRG are such onliners
[1:36:25] <+UbiLex> why would he be sleeping???!?!?
[1:36:26] <Jaybird54> Why did Jamez get kicked out of fpl?
[1:36:27] <+kass_twitch> is this a bo3?
[1:36:28] <roomate_7> where's swag?

[1:36:38] <+blazy253> where swag
[1:36:52] <+avmacke7> @kass_twitch yes it is
[1:36:59] <SubMur> C9 Should just kick Tarik all together lol
[1:37:00] <+UbiLex> @Mosski22 where does that info come from? reddit?
[1:37:00] <Penum> streamers can play fpl but not coaches? 🤔
[1:37:01] <+Der_Richi> i like how every second someone comes in asking where swag is

[1:54:35] <+pzode> @gzo852 He clearly was exaggerating, but the point stands that NRG should win this 85%+ of the time. They're definitely a class above Torqued. Obviously no team has a 0% chance of winning
[1:54:39] <anduCUHZ> @swedz96 they have improved a great deal that can't be argued.. but when you hear beast world.. just ignore. They could be in time.
