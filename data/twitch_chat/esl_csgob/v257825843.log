[0:14:05] <+TurbinePro> yeah, i dont get csgo splitted up by gender, but i guess its messy if you have 4 guys and one girl in a gaming house
[0:14:23] <iAmCyberwaste> I deally I want mixed teams to work and succeed, but I don't think it'll end up being a thing
[0:14:27] <+CliftonC9> Nice
[0:14:41] <+TurbinePro> but if they are niko levels of good teams would definitely make exceptions
[0:14:43] <iAmCyberwaste> If your brain is driven by what you see in movies yeah that's gonna keep being a thing

[1:58:38] <+Cruched> like why is it that women just arnt as good at video games, more physical or social reasons?
[1:58:56] <miss_invictus> Just need experience i guess
[1:58:59] <C_A_R_D_S> @cruched there are less females that play
[1:59:26] <$djchange> ‘Cause 80% boys play videogames and like %1 girls do
[1:59:26] <+Cruched> yea sure but how come the ones that do play arent as good
[1:59:32] <+Japancakes> LUL
[1:59:43] <$ImYungChubz> eh
[1:59:51] <+Cruched> no female olofs
[1:59:53] <+Japancakes> need more girls in games tho
[1:59:55] <$ImYungChubz> I don't think it is just gender dimorphism that is makes the women worse at cs
[1:59:55] <C_A_R_D_S> they aren’t inherently worse it’s that with less people a female only comp has a much higher skill gap so you might get 1 good player per team
[2:00:04] <+Cruched> im high af so im just thinkin here boys

[2:00:48] <$djchange> One girl in Sims4 has a bigger house than mine, she is so much better than me
[2:01:23] <+ayy_Nico> There's a lot of technical things to a game like CS that we dudes are just better at remembering when we play.

[2:01:40] <@Moobot> moobot http://intelextrememasters.com/raffle
[2:01:42] <$djchange> @ayy_nico like what?
[2:01:44] <+Cruched> @SASKID cause we can be
[2:01:54] <$ImYungChubz> Automod is fucking censoring me ree
[2:02:27] <+Japancakes> we all ree for icecreem
[2:02:31] <$ImYungChubz> I mean obviously there is a difference between the skill of men and women. it is just a fact of gender dimorphism, just look at the extremes such as the 100m sprint wr difference between genders
[2:02:34] <+dannnnnne> no
[2:02:50] <+Cruched> yea men have better reaction times etc.
[2:02:54] <+gero_30> shut the fuck up casters
[2:02:58] <+Japancakes> @ImYungChubz but only in specific categories, those are intensely physical
[2:03:10] <+ayy_Nico> There's probably less dedication to the scene as well, guys tend to no-life games more than chicks.
[2:03:18] <+Japancakes> ^
[2:03:22] <+Cruched> how often do women practice? as much as the men?
[2:03:30] <$djchange> @imyungchubz lol, that’s cause of the physical difference in muscles and such - not inside a computer based game
[2:03:39] <+ayy_Nico> I wouldn't say so, probably not as seriously
[2:03:40] <+Japancakes> who's that one overwatch chick that was owning? people thought she was hacking
[2:03:55] <+Cruched> guys more competitive? testosterone?
[2:04:17] <+ayy_Nico> R OMEGALUL A S T E D
[2:04:21] <$ImYungChubz> women have slower reaction times than men on average and in extremes
[2:04:34] <$ImYungChubz> there have been multiple studies that confirm this @djchange @Japancakes
[2:04:50] <+DevourAG> studies about what
[2:04:57] <$djchange> @imyungchubz whisper me links to these studies
[2:04:59] <$ImYungChubz> about reaction time
[2:05:03] <+simon_au> Is this the female finals?
[2:05:10] <+Cruched> would men still be better if there was no money in a male scene and all the money in a female scene
[2:06:03] <$djchange> There is no male scene, there is the «scene» and the «female scene». Females can join both, but choose to stay in the female one.
[2:06:22] <+Cruched> lmoa dude
[2:06:23] <+simon_au> Contact A ?
[2:06:40] <+Cruched> how much was the price pool for the male tourney?
[2:06:52] <+Cruched> prize*
[2:07:04] <+Behemot_001> 250 000
[2:07:11] <+Japancakes> @ImYungChubz for sure, but games like Hearthstone etc. wouldn't matter at all
[2:07:12] <kudejikashi> 200 viewers. . sheesh that's sad
[2:07:13] <FurrySaint> Cruched there is no male tourney
[2:07:21] <+DevourAG> wait wtf
[2:07:26] <+Cruched> how much money is the prize for the womens tourney?
[2:07:29] <+Japancakes> also some chick at the super high end of reaction times would still be better than most guys
[2:07:36] <$djchange> @cruched you mean the «tourney», not «male tourney». The main event is not gender based, only the female one is.
[2:08:41] <FurrySaint> Same as in many sports

[5:47:18] <+EfrumStarfire108> so, why do they have a women's only tournament? can't they compete in the same tournaments as the other teams?
[5:47:18] <@Moobot> moobot http://intelextrememasters.com/raffle
[5:48:48] <bigmansucc__> same reason they have other inclusive events for other things
[5:49:12] <bigmansucc__> just trying to get more of a female community in cs
[5:50:00] <HeigeTV> 3
[5:50:10] <bigmansucc__> like of course they can play in other tournies but tbh they aren't ever going to have any showcase through that
