[1:26:35] <+swenseng> are the map vetoes wrong on HLTV?
[1:26:52] <dawnisnear> Hltv says Gambit picked inferno
[1:27:02] <eliaschidekel> !maps
[1:27:02] <@Moobot> @eliaschidekel 1st map is Overpass (Astralis's pick), 2nd map is Inferno (Gambit's pick) & 3rd map is Train (decider)
[1:27:03] <xrealx369> @swenseng gj
[1:27:08] <Orapma09> @swenseng yea i got confused earlier
[1:27:08] <topblackjakc> @swenseng probably, they are wrong so often
[1:27:18] <naitikdass> gambit picking infi against astralis.. Rip gambit xD
[1:27:28] <+Luceapuce> tbh I have no idea who picked what LUL
[1:27:32] <Westerphalen> yea
[1:27:43] <Westerphalen> they are fucked
[1:27:44] <+Luceapuce> Moobot says one thing whereas the stream and IEM twitter account says another
[1:27:49] <Orapma09> alot getting Jebaited by HLTV
[1:27:52] <teh_tutti> match started lol
[1:27:55] <devmalla> gambit picked overpass, astralis picked inferno
[1:27:58] <Westerphalen> moobot, best bot
[1:27:59] <ZiffDK> #dogfart
[1:28:09] <Itz_skillez> Astralis Pick inferno and gambit over
[1:28:15] <Orapma09> GG
[1:28:24] <Orapma09> mowed down
[1:28:34] <@Insomniuhh> That's not what HLTV says
[1:28:41] <bradds> @Itz_skillez Gambit picked Inferno
[1:28:51] <Orapma09> seized throwing LUL
[1:29:15] <Itz_skillez> No idiot
[1:29:16] <JollyLilDudeManBro> what the fuck is this autistic five minute ad
[1:29:28] <+Tate827> @itz_skillez yes they did
[1:29:32] <KreoDK> overpass is Astralis' best map, doubt gambit would pick it
[1:29:33] <+Tate827> !maps
[1:29:33] <@Moobot> @Tate827 1st map is Overpass (Astralis's pick), 2nd map is Inferno (Gambit's pick) & 3rd map is Train (decider)
[1:29:38] <Mrpotatohead777> @JollyLilDudeManBro just refresh your page
[1:29:59] <petexcsgo> The picks are wrong, no way Gambit banned nuke. I promise.
[1:30:03] <Mrpotatohead777> even the casters said overpass was gambit's pick and that's what the overlay said before
[1:30:29] <fedfisse3210> @Insomniuhh No but HLTV also says that Astralis banned Nuke and Gambit banned Cobblestone - that makes no sense.
[1:30:45] <+SweekEU> !maps
[1:30:46] <@Moobot> @SweekEU 1st map is Overpass (Astralis's pick), 2nd map is Inferno (Gambit's pick) & 3rd map is Train (decider)
[1:30:47] <+Tate827> @petexcsgo yeah astralis banned nuke and wanted cobble
