[2:47:15] <S1L3Nc3R666> @TheGreenRobotProduct Yeah same. FNS is not the best fragger but he is a smart player
[2:47:20] <@ekuc> the bot didnt like that Kootss monkaS
[2:47:23] <Armory_6> FNS is doing really well for c9
[2:47:31] <TheGreenRobotProduct> True.
[2:47:31] <@Moobot> Day 3 starts in about: 8h 13m 7s FeelsGoodMan Clap
[2:47:35] <+frantictv_> Honestly FNS is more beneficial to c9 than stewie

[2:51:17] <+thehollowaytape> brax is too patient lol
[2:51:23] <+thehollowaytape> he baits his whole team
[2:51:42] <Armory_6> @thehollowaytape i meant after he baits his team lol
[2:51:51] <TheGreenRobotProduct> In CS you cant be impatient 24/7. But you cant always be patient 24/7 either. You need someone thats balanced between the two.
[2:52:09] <+thehollowaytape> @TheGreenRobotProduct aka having good timing
[2:52:15] <exuvium> is this live?
[2:52:20] <TheGreenRobotProduct> basically
[2:52:22] <Taldeaux> f0rest!
[2:52:26] <maeratv> yes its a live rerun
[2:52:34] <+mxcheese> did they play today?
[2:52:47] <+Kootss> rerun chats greatest downfall
[2:53:41] <maeratv> ropz is crazy good though
[2:53:47] <+ajr_tv> your opinion matters
[2:55:14] <TheGreenRobotProduct> @thehollowaytape I still need to learn when to peek n shit tbh. (Cough cough S2 still bc when you solo all the time its hard cough cough)
[2:55:16] <exuvium> id love to swallow a load from ropz
[2:55:35] <Taldeaux> who let that kid wear a bandana?!
[2:55:48] <Taldeaux> where are that kids parents
[2:55:53] <TheGreenRobotProduct> I'd only take a swallow from Skadoodle.
[2:56:10] <TheGreenRobotProduct> @Armory_6 4th match into faceit. I got fucking ddosed.
[2:56:10] <maeratv> he saw machinegun kelly on youtube
[2:56:18] <exuvium> @Armory_6 silver playing in pugs is just asking for a bad time tbh
[2:56:38] <+Kootss> Fr
[2:56:41] <TheGreenRobotProduct> And then I dont want to pay for ESEA due to reasons.
[2:56:42] <exuvium> i think when youre that low rank you can still learn a lot from mm
[2:57:25] <+Kootss> lmao
[2:57:26] <TheGreenRobotProduct> @exuvium i use to play with some LEMS on smurfs.
[2:57:35] <+Kootss> got slumpt
[2:57:36] <Armory_6> wow
[2:57:40] <TheGreenRobotProduct> But yeah i still have alot to learn.
[2:57:50] <Armory_6> i didnt even say anything bad
[2:58:00] <+Kootss> long paragraphs will do it
[2:58:06] <Armory_6> mods being all rude and stuff
[2:58:13] <+Kootss> it's the bot lol
[2:58:24] <Armory_6> stupid bot
[2:58:41] <Punisher_360> I played esea when I was silver 4 and it was indeed a bad time
[2:58:46] <tykus20> thott bot
[2:58:51] <exuvium> @TheGreenRobotProduct LUL i dont get it, what's the significance of playing with smurfs
[2:59:10] <+Kootss> I'm dmg and I've been fucked on in pugs before lol
[2:59:13] <Armory_6> im sem and playing on faceit is better for learning cause people make callouts and use utility
[2:59:27] <TheGreenRobotProduct> @exuvium Depending on the person. They teach you and give you tips while playing.
[2:59:35] <Taldeaux> using the d.e.n.n.i.s. system
[2:59:44] <Punisher_360> I'm mg now but back then whoo boy esea was tough
[2:59:46] <Armory_6> i regularly get 15+ kills and we win pretty easily. its just communication and utility
[2:59:53] <exuvium> ah ok. the way you said it you made it sound like playing with smurfs meant you were a good player MingLee
[3:00:05] <S1L3Nc3R666> im stuck MGE in MM i cant get enough wins or enough losses lol
[3:00:25] <Punisher_360> yeah I been mg forever it feels lmao
[3:00:34] <+Kootss> @s1l3nc3r666 yep lol once you start to hit mge you gotta be nuts at one map or something to get out
[3:00:50] <S1L3Nc3R666> half the time i get the worst teams and half the time i get the best teams
[3:00:55] <+Kootss> I got to dmg because I'm sick on train and it was all I would play lol
[3:00:55] <Armory_6> of course there are games where i get fucked on, but i take it well cause i know if i keep practicing ill get there
[3:01:03] <TheGreenRobotProduct> @S1L3Nc3R666 Fucking same
[3:01:09] <SantoNEEE> !bracket
[3:01:09] <@Moobot> @SantoNEEE http://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/DreamHack/2018/Marseille
[3:01:18] <Punisher_360> most games I get fucked on I have the WORST timing lmao
[3:01:18] <@Moobot> @moobot DreamHack Store: http://kappa.ly/store
[3:01:26] <Punisher_360> its tragic
[3:01:30] <+Kootss> I was playing lems and Supremes alot just playing train cause no one plays train LUL
[3:01:47] <S1L3Nc3R666> i swear sometimes i will hold an angle for the half the round and the minute i turn away i get peeked
[3:01:58] <Punisher_360> LITERALLT^
[3:02:04] <tykus20> wtf music is that.. its like a game show
[3:02:05] <+Kootss> simple don't stop holding the angle Kappa
[3:02:08] <exuvium> @S1L3Nc3R666 lmao i call that the rando rule.
[3:02:17] <maeratv> chrisj needs to remove this mustach and haircut style like adolf.h
[3:02:20] <exuvium> no matter how long u hold an angle the very moment you stop looking you get peeked
[3:02:21] <Armory_6> my aim is bad, but i use utility and my callouts are good, so my teams on faceit dont hate me for bottom fragging lol. I give good info
[3:02:37] <Pivel_> timing is learned
[3:02:43] <S1L3Nc3R666> Infact my last game the half ended 14-1 and ended up losing 16-5
[3:02:46] <+Kootss> eh
[3:02:48] <TheGreenRobotProduct> I bottom frag after 2-3 hrs after is start playing.
[3:03:03] <Armory_6> take breaks man
[3:03:11] <nftyw> It's pretty mellow in here
[3:03:15] <Punisher_360> idk how these dudes do lans, its exhausting playing a lot in a day lol
[3:03:28] <Punisher_360> I was gears of war pro and this game is much more exhausting
[3:03:31] <TheGreenRobotProduct> ^
[3:03:32] <nftyw> too used to the usual spamming in the chat, I guess
[3:03:32] <@Moobot> @moobot Follow DreamHack on http://kappa.ly/twitter - http://kappa.ly/facebook - http://kappa.ly/instagram - http://kappa.ly/snapchat - http://kappa.ly/youtube

[3:04:13] <nftyw> denniss
[3:04:21] <+Kootss> we had no air conditioning for the summer id just sit outside and play lol
[3:04:22] <TheGreenRobotProduct> I gotta manage 1/3 of a team 24/7...
[3:04:26] <Armory_6> id be dead after 4 hours. i only play 2-3 faciet pugs a day. any more than that and i start losing concentration
[3:04:28] <TheGreenRobotProduct> so not that bad
[3:04:32] <+Kootss> it was to hot to do anything else
[3:04:37] <TheFailedStrategist> this game was the greatest upset LUL cryJ

[3:09:30] <+Mentalkiller_> n0thingBurrito
[3:09:40] <KingKuntaSneep> Not really "destroyed", they won 16-13 and 16-14
[3:09:44] <Punisher_360> what's up with sk?
[3:09:54] <TheFailedStrategist> today is envy v faze, fnatic v renegades and sk v mouz
[3:09:55] <maeratv> stewie joined l<ul
[3:10:04] <TheFailedStrategist> gambit v liquid
[3:10:04] <mertcursed> wtf
[3:10:07] <+Panda0Bearr> wtf was dat
[3:10:10] <+avmacke7> OOF DAMN FOREST
[3:10:14] <+imraaaay> Only wanna see sk
[3:10:17] <nftyw> black lam
[3:10:35] <+imraaaay> Other teams are boring
[3:10:42] <+avmacke7> sure thing bud
[3:10:48] <TheFailedStrategist> nah sk is boring now
[3:11:05] <+avmacke7> u sure its not just ur an sk fanbou, because i think most teams are fun to watch
[3:11:05] <nftyw> sk doesnt seem infuriatingly consistant anymore
[3:11:05] <+imraaaay> Lately but I still like them just hate that traitor
[3:11:07] <maeratv> flusha <3
[3:11:19] <+avmacke7> sk has been less fun to watch since their play dropped off
[3:11:21] <+imraaaay> Nah I’m pure blood c9
[3:11:23] <TheFailedStrategist> its nice to see there's no clear era like faze era or sk era, everyone can win these days
[3:11:35] <+avmacke7> oof gross
[3:11:38] <Punisher_360> I like watching bolts and fallen
[3:11:47] <nftyw> well used to be sk was kryptonite to everyone
[3:11:55] <salad_ass69_> na flash
[3:11:55] <+imraaaay> And I like taco but man he hasn’t been doing much
[3:11:56] <nftyw> now its like they got figured out or something
[3:11:56] <TheGreenRobotProduct> THAT FLASH THO. xD
[3:12:11] <+Noah808state> 909
[3:12:18] <Punisher_360> fallen is just so fuckin sketch lol
[3:12:26] <Punisher_360> favorite thing about watching him
[3:12:31] <TheFailedStrategist> every team is in flux now, sk is new with stewie, faze is new with xzit, liquid is new with taco
[3:12:35] <nftyw> that guy made my blood boil lol
[3:12:47] <exuvium> wait
[3:12:47] <baldboy12> cmonBruh
[3:12:52] <+avmacke7> navi has been doing good
[3:12:56] <exuvium> stewie is on sk? like brazilian sk with coldzera and fallen?
[3:13:01] <+avmacke7> same with astralis
[3:13:02] <mertcursed> EleGiggle
[3:13:03] <nftyw> yes
[3:13:09] <+avmacke7> and yes brazilian sk
[3:13:10] <exuvium> lol wtf
[3:13:10] <nftyw> stewie and taco swapped
[3:13:13] <+imraaaay> Skadoodle been going off lately
[3:13:15] <Punisher_360> for some reason
[3:13:22] <+avmacke7> taco went to liquid
[3:13:22] <+TheKightsWhoSayNi> lmfao that Bully hunters shade
[3:13:24] <Punisher_360> why stew left c9 is beyond me
[3:13:24] <@Moobot> Enter the DreamHack CS:GO giveaway here - dh.je/giveaway
[3:13:28] <exuvium> skadaddy is really consistent on lan
[3:13:30] <maeratv> skadoodle is pwning
[3:13:42] <nftyw> liquid? who was it that c9 picked up instead
[3:13:45] <+imraaaay> Stewie thought c9 sucked and they couldn’t win
[3:13:50] <Punisher_360> fans
[3:13:55] <+avmacke7> c9 got FNS
[3:13:56] <TheFailedStrategist> c9 picked up fns
[3:14:01] <Punisher_360> fns
[3:14:02] <nftyw> lol thats right
[3:14:07] <exuvium> skadoodle is op cuz his reactions dont atrophy the longer he holds a corner. he can watch something for a minute straight and still react instantly
[3:14:07] <TheFailedStrategist> fns with the 5000iq plays LUL
[3:14:09] <+avmacke7> yup
[3:14:12] <nftyw> people were all 'fns???'
[3:14:17] <+imraaaay> Fns been producing big time. I like him a lot
[3:14:22] <Punisher_360> @exuvium literally lol isn't that nuts
[3:14:22] <salad_ass69_> Kreygasm
[3:14:30] <+dutchtouch1> skadoodle is garbage
[3:14:32] <nftyw> I need to watch more games but no time
[3:14:37] <nftyw> esp with the new lineups
[3:14:52] <TheFailedStrategist> nobody can replace ska for now, who they gonna get? jdm?
[3:14:56] <+avmacke7> ya c9 needed a real IGL and now tarik is free to frag and RUSH has been doing amazzing since fns joined
[3:14:57] <+fafinaf1> Find some highlights @nftyw
[3:15:03] <+avmacke7> they could get cerQ
[3:15:03] <+imraaaay> I hope c9 take this major. So stewie can cry
[3:15:04] <nftyw> mouse and nip are impressing me a lot
[3:15:10] <Punisher_360> fuckin tarik is going HARD lately
[3:15:14] <exuvium> @imraaaay that would be hilarious
[3:15:20] <TheFailedStrategist> nah NIP is coming back
[3:15:21] <+avmacke7> what about NaVi? theyve been doing great>
[3:15:35] <+fafinaf1> Space Soldiers what happened
[3:15:37] <nftyw> yeah team simple is doing pretty amazing
[3:15:39] <+avmacke7> and tru nip is doing great
[3:15:40] <Punisher_360> navi have been good. adding electronic was a good idea
[3:15:50] <TheFailedStrategist> navi depends on the day lol, s1mple can carry then but its literally a 1v9 sometimes
[3:15:55] <Punisher_360> lmao
[3:15:58] <+dutchtouch1> having simple carry even more is a good strategy
[3:16:02] <+avmacke7> lol everyone on navi has been playing great last couple weeks
[3:16:14] <+AjCapa> fns is a good igl
[3:16:20] <marc4361> who won this match?
[3:16:26] <Punisher_360> fns been going hard lately too
[3:16:28] <+avmacke7> s1mple in an interview said he talked with coach and theyve changed some things, so i think their recent success is here to stay
[3:16:32] <TheFailedStrategist> like i said, sometimes depends on the day for navi, if they feel it then they will be good
[3:16:46] <+dutchtouch1> NiP beat mouse
[3:16:57] <nftyw> oh yeah virtus pro
[3:16:58] <marc4361> thnks
[3:17:02] <nftyw> that michu guy
[3:17:04] <+theunclejemima> LUL
[3:17:10] <Punisher_360> michu is nuts
[3:17:11] <TheFailedStrategist> this map is disgusting with oskar on the shotgun
[3:17:15] <+avmacke7> i think navi's form is here to stay
[3:17:39] <TheFailedStrategist> hopefull, hate to see s1mple talents wasted on navi, rooting for them just for s1mple
[3:17:54] <Punisher_360> simple deserves some wins lol
[3:17:58] <TheFailedStrategist> s1mple deserves more than he does right now
[3:18:01] <+torillatavataans> has ENCE played any matches yet?
[3:18:06] <+imraaaay> Simple is over rated he’s not that good
[3:18:07] <TheFailedStrategist> nope
[3:18:18] <+avmacke7> im rooting for them bc i love the core of s1mple flamie electronic, and my family is all from ukraine and russia, and poland. and ur right s1mple deserves championships
[3:18:21] <YourBoyChaseOG> it will which will be stupi
[3:18:21] <TheFailedStrategist> lol s1mple not that good? k
[3:18:32] <RickyW> @TheFailedStrategist are u dumb? k
[3:18:33] <+avmacke7> and bullshit imraaaay, s1mple is best player in the world
[3:18:43] <+imraaaay> Eh he’s good but not the besg
[3:18:51] <RickyW> if anything he's top 3 though
[3:18:55] <TheFailedStrategist> @RickyW maybe you cant read stats, maybe you are dumb? k
[3:18:55] <Rub3nix> QOTA
[3:18:58] <Punisher_360> I dont think hes the best either, damn good tho
[3:19:02] <+avmacke7> he is easily the best, if u watch the game or look at stats he is best
[3:19:06] <RickyW> @TheFailedStrategist xd triggered
[3:19:09] <+avmacke7> no one is close to s1mple atm
[3:19:16] <+avmacke7> tell me who is even as good as him
[3:19:23] <+jonsben> true ^
[3:19:24] <+avmacke7> you cant
[3:19:28] <RickyW> @avmacke7 niko and cold are the only options
[3:19:31] <Contrefaire> s1mple so bad, such noob, doge better, much wow. CorgiDerp
[3:19:43] <+avmacke7> and theyre not at his level, they are the closest tho
[3:19:45] <RickyW> s1mple 4Head so 4Head bad 4Head
[3:19:52] <nftyw> faze shoulda bought simple
[3:19:59] <+avmacke7> tru
[3:20:04] <Punisher_360> simple would prolly tear faze apart if he rages lol
[3:20:07] <RickyW> @avmacke7 did you see niko play against c9 htough
[3:20:18] <+avmacke7> idc, one match
[3:20:22] <+imraaaay> Niko, xypx, skadoodle, device.
[3:20:26] <+avmacke7> have u seen both of them play all of 2018 tho
[3:20:27] <RickyW> you cant really have niko and s1mple on the same team, fighting to be the star player and for the frags
[3:20:29] <TheFailedStrategist> would have been interesting to see if the actual s1mple and flamie move to sk
[3:20:32] <+avmacke7> its not even a competition atm
[3:20:39] <+jonsben> lol

[5:57:27] <@Moobot> @IAnswerToNoOne Uptime is: 5h 57m 36s :)
[5:57:34] <simplyBender> bit soon to judge SK form with new roster
[5:57:40] <+Talha215> goodnight, chat. It's been a lovely conversation
[5:57:43] <Hadanki> The guy is a pure hater

[5:57:51] <+El_burrito_man> yes
[5:57:56] <budaksunway> @avmacke7 navi has never win any major 4Head
[5:58:00] <IAnswerToNoOne> It is a live rerun.
[5:58:01] <+avmacke7> still, navi better than sk, i dont actually think sk is shit, and i hope they start getting back to their old form
[5:58:06] <IAnswerToNoOne> If that makes sense
[5:58:15] <+avmacke7> rerun is sponsor
[5:58:21] <+El_burrito_man> i doubt that @ianswertonoone
[5:58:33] <+El_burrito_man> and stick to ur name
[5:58:43] <jamesonkinder> 2018?
[5:58:44] <stoned_spider> best damn sponsor esports has ever seen
[5:58:44] <simplyBender> my theory is that pressure affects individual form more than basic teamwork
[5:58:50] <budaksunway> navi is a specialist in failure cause they always choke in big games0
[5:58:53] <phantomm70> then nip should get back to their old form too -_-
[5:59:06] <+avmacke7> sure thing bud
[5:59:11] <stoned_spider> good theory
[5:59:34] <+avmacke7> phantom i hope nip do i love them
[5:59:47] <stoned_spider> my theory is platypi sounds better than platypusses
[5:59:48] <poltergeistjedi> LOL

[6:11:28] <stoned_spider> pretty sure they're all pro
[6:11:29] <+OfficialTJ> I love to watch its just hard to trust some of the shit they do tbh
[6:11:39] <Daruz_Siro> son todos gringos cajetas
[6:11:40] <simplyBender> definately not FailedStrategist
[6:11:46] <TheFailedStrategist> honestly, they gotta build around s1mple
[6:11:48] <simplyBender> but we were talking about current CS
[6:11:58] <simplyBender> not CS from years ago
[6:12:07] <+bagelboy20> @OfficialTJ have you ever played this game at a high level? Theyre not cheating.
[6:12:08] <budaksunway> navi is chocker and they will lose this dreamhack
[6:12:13] <muhabbetkrali> türk yokmu
[6:12:19] <insane_midget> maybe so
[6:12:20] <TheFailedStrategist> you said before 2018, so i was just pointing out that fnatic 2015 did actually dominate
[6:12:33] <+OfficialTJ> flushas screen?
[6:12:40] <simplyBender> yah ok, could have said 2017 Fnatic
[6:12:41] <TheFailedStrategist> olof fnatic era
[6:13:03] <budaksunway> navi will never ever win anything major even in the future
[6:13:08] <TheFailedStrategist> yeah that would be better i admit, 2017 fnatic was trash
[6:13:17] <stoned_spider> 5 hp
[6:13:18] <Daruz_Siro> ad
[6:13:21] <TheFailedStrategist> when disco was still in
[6:13:25] <VillageGrown> and you will never win an MM budak
[6:13:39] <Daruz_Siro> wasd KENNYS IS S1mple its inexplicabl
[6:14:05] <budaksunway> @villagegrown navi never win any major in csgo and have disappointed many navi fan
[6:14:06] <TheFailedStrategist> you gotta admit when olof left fnatic, they were kinda trash until they brought in golden
[6:14:08] <VillageGrown> Because winning a major is so easy..
[6:14:31] <budaksunway> @villagegrown navi have guardian and simple they cant win shit
[6:14:40] <simplyBender> same reason i dont think current Faze will win
[6:14:53] <simplyBender> xist a great player but he isnt olof
[6:15:14] <TheFailedStrategist> zeus in navi is trash but zeus in gambit was Kreygasm
[6:15:22] <budaksunway> @villagegrown they always fail when its important cause their mentality was weak
[6:15:28] <+avmacke7> watch s1mple in this round budak
[6:15:39] <simplyBender> i think zeus' problem was confidence
[6:15:43] <+avmacke7> just wait for the end of round
[6:15:45] <VillageGrown> haha
[6:15:57] <+avmacke7> im thinking of a different round
[6:16:04] <VillageGrown> This dude is 100% a silver
[6:16:05] <+HelioBud> what an eco wtf
[6:16:15] <+avmacke7> LUL fnatic
[6:16:17] <simplyBender> dealing with that toxic af navi squad for years messed with zeus head imo
[6:16:17] <VillageGrown> weak mentality.
[6:16:18] <TheFailedStrategist> they need to release JW, he inconsistent AF
[6:16:18] <Ostarava> which dues silver?
[6:16:23] <+Splorcher111> 74CO
[6:16:31] <+El_burrito_man> LUL Navi
[6:16:31] <TheFailedStrategist> @simplyBender yeah possibly
[6:16:32] <+HelioBud> bro what kind of tattoo is that??
[6:16:34] <+avmacke7> lol zues is one of the more toxic ones
[6:16:49] <TheFailedStrategist> but you gotta admit zeus lead gambit to the majors
[6:16:53] <simplyBender> not saying he isnt avmacke7
[6:16:54] <TheFailedStrategist> look at gambit now
[6:16:57] <+avmacke7> @El_burrito_man you mad you lost? teach golden to spray and krimz to not whiff
[6:17:08] <+Splorcher111> xGod FeelsBadMan
[6:17:11] <budaksunway> @villagegrown @avmacke7 navi will never win any major in the future they are specialist in failure
[6:17:14] <simplyBender> gambit winning the major was one of my fav CS events
[6:17:29] <VillageGrown> literally no one cares.
[6:17:43] <VillageGrown> I'm here for the gameplay
[6:17:45] <simplyBender> yeah - how dare we talk about CS in a CS stream
[6:17:47] <TheFailedStrategist> so im not really sure what happened, zeus left gambit, they werent as good, but he came back to navi and its the same as it ever is
[6:17:53] <Bigbubble89> @simplybender gambit made me a little more rich
[6:17:54] <+avmacke7> fr
[6:17:59] <+Splorcher111> Torques will win a major Kappa
[6:18:24] <+BoneyFingersBill> no they wont?
[6:18:27] <+avmacke7> NaVi has been doing pretty good recently, nothing lower than semifinals at any lan theyve attended 2018
[6:18:54] <simplyBender> it shows how important a relevant IGL is
[6:19:13] <budaksunway> @avmacke7 doing good doesnt means shit if u didnt win anything major when u have huge fanbase
[6:19:23] <simplyBender> having basic strats is too 1 dimensional
[6:19:30] <simplyBender> gotta have depth
[6:19:33] <Ostarava> yeah i dont think lebron can captain navi honestly
[6:19:36] <+El_burrito_man> lol im messing with u @avmacke7 and im loving it man...every comment i make, you take it right up the as

[7:10:24] <+net00> LUL
[7:10:25] <nadjii> yep
[7:10:28] <ozric_> 16 4 and 16 3?
[7:10:36] <ozric_> fucking smurfs
[7:10:36] <+Kootss> @trytosaymynamebackwards ooof
[7:10:39] <nadjii> ....?
[7:10:41] <ozric_> xD
[7:11:02] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> EU has a lot of middle tier teams. NA is top heavy
[7:11:10] <nadjii> stop urself
[7:11:11] <+Kootss> tru
[7:11:13] <ozric_> its hard being a faze fan atm
[7:11:16] <nadjii> burns the eye
[7:11:26] <+Kootss> faze fans LUL
[7:11:32] <nadjii> I saw Hiko play in denmark
[7:11:41] <nadjii> he plays in Pro league in NA right?
[7:11:44] <+Vincent__159> ceh9So ceh9Sa ceh9Tbred
[7:11:53] <nadjii> He ended up at the B-tournament in copenhagen games
[7:11:56] <+net00> didn't Faze rek c9 at katowice and
[7:11:58] <+Kootss> on rogue
[7:11:59] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> niko is the lebron of csgo. good without pressure but chokes HARD in high pressure
[7:12:01] <nadjii> it was kinda sad
[7:12:28] <+Kootss> @nadjii he makes mad money tho
[7:12:31] <nadjii> my point is. stop urself :D
[7:12:41] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> tarik is one of the best high pressure lpayers in the world
[7:12:44] <puppynochulo> NA LUL
[7:12:52] <nadjii> NA though
[7:12:57] <nadjii> what a sh itty scene
[7:13:11] <nadjii> mediocre danish teams playing even against ur pro teams
[7:13:17] <+Kootss> how many majors has eu won lately 🤔
[7:13:21] <ozric_> I do appreciate tarik
[7:13:25] <ozric_> amazing player
[7:13:29] <nadjii> Every one that exist
[7:13:36] <nadjii> tahts how many
[7:13:39] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> a tournament with C9, SK, and Liquid without anyone else is a t1 tourny
[7:13:59] <+Kootss> I recall c9 then gambit and a few sk ones before that @nadjii
[7:14:06] <nadjii> lol
[7:14:23] <nadjii> its all EU dude except a few ones xD
[7:14:28] <nadjii> welcome to cs
[7:14:38] <+Kootss> but y'all ain't winning 🤔
[7:14:40] <puppynochulo> almost all EU until SK happened
[7:14:49] <nadjii> only one team can win man xD
[7:14:51] <simplyBender> CS scene finally has regional diversity
[7:14:53] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> EU has a lot of washed up players. NA is getting stacked, more development and bigger pool of players. plus we arent poor so we can afford good computers LuL
[7:15:01] <+net00> what has c9 won besides the major OMEGALUL
[7:15:05] <nadjii> NA is not getting stacked at all
[7:15:17] <nadjii> it has literally 3 teams thats worth mentioning
[7:15:20] <+Pandaman38> wait till i go pro
[7:15:21] <puppynochulo> NA getting stacked? LUL
[7:15:21] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> NA will have 4 t1 teams by 2019
[7:15:29] <+Kootss> I can appreciate the irony of tarik playing like this now when na was a joke for playing the same way a few years back
[7:15:40] <nadjii> Fnatic, Faze, Astralis, Mousesports, Navi
[7:15:43] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> C9 TL NRG Torqued
[7:15:49] <nadjii> i can go on and on and on and on
[7:16:05] <nadjii> and then I can tell hiko good luck in b-torurnament in copenhagen games after my dude
[7:16:09] <+Kootss> am excited to see nrg on lan this summer they've been looking nice
[7:16:23] <L33P4> vac
[7:17:02] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> sweden was the closest to having 3 tier1 teams but never happened. godsent never lived up to hype. NA has the player pool to make 4+ top teams
[7:17:14] <nadjii> At the end of the day, as stewie sayd in the interview a few days ago in marseille. every team in NA is SK fanboys and will copy them and join them any day of the week
[7:17:21] <+Kootss> just a question of if they're actually ss levels of online
[7:17:42] <nadjii> So u really only have one team in the entire NA that can compete
[7:17:50] <nadjii> While EU has what, 10?
[7:17:51] <+Kootss> @nadjii funny he says that when Tim turned them down already
[7:17:56] <simplyBender> only 1 team with demonstrated results so far
[7:18:05] <nadjii> Sure he did buddy
[7:18:13] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> SK is the best in the world no doubt but they already peaked. they've been plateauing for a while
[7:18:16] <nadjii> And simple turned down SK, whats the point here? xD
[7:18:16] <@Moobot> @moobot Follow DreamHack on http://kappa.ly/twitter - http://kappa.ly/facebook - http://kappa.ly/instagram - http://kappa.ly/snapchat - http://kappa.ly/youtube
[7:18:46] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> all those "top 10" eu teams have been stagnant while NA teams been moving up
[7:18:55] <nadjii> Stagnant? lol
[7:19:09] <+net00> ^
[7:19:17] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> those players are the same as they were 10 years ago. these NA kids under 20 are way better skillwise
[7:19:17] <puppynochulo> Stagnant LUL LUL
[7:19:18] <nadjii> What tournament
[7:19:23] <simplyBender> better to have a conversation about LAN results imo
[7:19:30] <simplyBender> online CS is garbage
[7:19:34] <+s1m0> Simple didn’t turn down SK. Navi wanted 900 k for he and flamie, simple was all in
[7:19:38] <nadjii> What tournament besides the major did a NA team win? Tell me
[7:19:44] <nadjii> Lately
[7:19:51] <+net00> ^^^
[7:19:57] <+Kootss> @s1m0 and they wanted to transfer him when they felt like it lol
[7:20:04] <nadjii> Mr stagnant
[7:20:10] <nadjii> What tourneys u guys winning?
[7:20:14] <+Kootss> @nadjii what major has eu won lately? tell me
[7:20:22] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> Eu keeps shuffling around the same players, very little new talent. NRG is a brand new squad that is gonna do damage in 2019
[7:20:23] <nadjii> Everyone that exist
[7:20:32] <+Kootss> this guy
[7:20:35] <nadjii> LOL

[7:22:42] <Pivel_> we'll see
[7:22:43] <+tachikomaas> there was mod here
[7:22:44] <+Trytosaymynamebackwards> EU is like those SEC fans in NCAA football. root for a continent instead of a country lol
[7:22:49] <nadjii> Just stick to the facts instead of ur pocket theorys
[7:22:54] <nadjii> EU rules everything atm
[7:23:03] <nadjii> astralis v liquid was a good example of that
[7:23:10] <LifesaLemon> nadjii you need real hobbies buddy
[7:23:17] <+Kootss> lol
[7:23:17] <Pivel_> everything but major LUL

[7:50:08] <anko69> with 3 colors for NO REASON

[7:57:35] <xerract11> why faze gets hate
[7:57:57] <anko69> because faze paid 5 million for their roster and still lose
[7:58:07] <kbyst3r> Bot
[7:58:10] <+Kootss> same reason the warriors do in the nba
[7:58:18] <anko69> and their logo is ugly, and faze is a cod org
[7:58:31] <simplyBender> Faze picking their roster was the best thing for CSGo
[7:58:37] <simplyBender> showed you didnt have to stick to same country
[7:58:39] <xerract11> beause faze paid a lot money for roster?
[7:58:43] <simplyBender> or language, rather
[7:58:51] <+Kootss> tru tru
[7:59:06] <+Kootss> but still fuck them lol
[7:59:10] <anko69> most teams in dota are international, that's been happening for a long time now
[7:59:18] <+Treehumping101> FaZe doing that was good for cs but they should still get shit for it
[7:59:26] <simplyBender> what's a do ta
[7:59:36] <xerract11> i think faze is very entertaining to watch i think everyone is just salty beause faze won agisnt theirt fav team and didnt win final
[7:59:38] <+Treehumping101> doter
[7:59:50] <anko69> tober wan doter
[7:59:56] <simplyBender> Karrigans curse continues FeelsBadMan
[7:59:58] <+Kootss> and every kid new to cs is a faze fan
[8:00:20] <xerract11> i am guardian and niko fan from 2015
[8:00:20] <+Treehumping101> fnatic need to retire Kappa
[8:00:30] <xerract11> before they joined faze
[8:00:31] <+Fatspiders> Kappa
[8:00:48] <+Fatspiders> btw Tainted Minds won
[8:00:50] <+Treehumping101> olof retire when
[8:00:55] <+Fatspiders> if anyone cares
[8:01:01] <simplyBender> you cant be a CSGO fan and not appreciate Faze roster
[8:01:02] <kbyst3r> What team is olof on
[8:01:03] <xerract11> guardian curse because guardian lost 3 times 2 nd place in major
[8:01:09] <+Kootss> won what
[8:01:18] <xerract11> olof is on faze he is taking a break
[8:01:20] <anko69> no one denies faze is the best team in the world, but what's the fun in cheering for the best
[8:01:27] <anko69> that's like rooting for the bully on the playground

[8:01:54] <outbreeak> sk already played?
[8:01:58] <xerract11> i think faze panic that why they lose they need a physiatrist
[8:02:04] <+Fatspiders> C9 GOAT
[8:02:07] <+raasco> edward FeelsBadMan
[8:02:11] <anko69> C9 GOAT
[8:02:16] <xerract11> they are not mentally strong in tense situation
[8:02:18] <+Treehumping101> NA logic
[8:02:33] <simplyBender> I reckon one of the hardest things in the world is to win the last map of hte tourney in OT
[8:02:36] <+Fatspiders> well c9 did win major so iq goes up by -30
[8:02:36] <+imraaaay> SkAdoodle > simple
[8:02:40] <anko69> but c9 is one of like 2 teams that has faze's number
[8:02:45] <anko69> the other team is sk
[8:03:02] <+Kootss> gambit used to
[8:03:02] <+Fatspiders> sk will never be the same without fnx
[8:03:07] <+raasco> just go die edward
[8:03:09] <simplyBender> can you still continue a C9 legacy with a different IGL?
[8:03:10] <+Fatspiders> even tho he was toxic
[8:03:14] <+Treehumping101> they arent even the best in the world rn let alone all time

[9:12:06] <+bustatron_24> where did jdm go?

[9:12:30] <Foxyfluffy> I'm spooped
[9:12:35] <+ISpeirz> @bustatron_24 kicked for being bad
[9:12:41] <+bustatron_24> lol
[9:12:45] <+ISpeirz> so he grinds fpl all day now
[9:12:46] <OE_97> not perfornubg
[9:12:52] <+bustatron_24> so he isn't playing?
[9:12:53] <OE_97> performing
[9:13:05] <+ISpeirz> for liquid? no
[9:13:09] <scoobyweed> i think yes man .. it gives me tactics and something like 6th sense in mm because most players dont think they just shoot ..
[9:13:09] <+ISpeirz> he streams alot
[9:13:15] <+bustatron_24> any pro team
[9:13:18] <+ISpeirz> because he isnt playing for anyone now
[9:13:21] <OE_97> nope doesn't have a team
[9:13:25] <+bustatron_24> ok
[9:13:48] <+ISpeirz> i think there was rumours that c9 was gonna get him because skadoodle was leaving
[9:13:56] <+ISpeirz> but then skadoodle didnt leave so c9 was saved
[9:14:12] <+bustatron_24> ska didn't leave cuz stew left
[9:14:15] <OE_97> yes i've heard that aswell
[9:14:19] <scoobyweed> skadaddy is gonna carry i think
[9:14:31] <+ISpeirz> ska was demotivated at the time, he is okayish now
[9:14:41] <OE_97> Ska needs some structure
[9:14:53] <OE_97> and he got it now with FNS
[9:15:01] <+bustatron_24> I just hope sk doesn't do much with stew
[9:15:06] <+ISpeirz> he protecc, he atacc, but most importantly, daddy is bacc
[9:15:27] <scoobyweed> do you know today is 420 day ?..
[9:15:31] <timz8> I hate when people say ska, typing is understandable, but people can’t say 1 more word....
[9:15:43] <+ISpeirz> for me its 204 day
[9:15:47] <timz8> I wish I could smoke scooby 😢
[9:15:47] <OE_97> SK won't win this tounament tho
[9:16:04] <scoobyweed> for me too man i quit weed :D
[9:16:04] <+ISpeirz> sk will be lucky to get to the semi finals
[9:16:07] <+bustatron_24> I hope c9 does to throw it at stew
[9:16:19] <trunks4210> why busta
[9:16:45] <wisearn> i quit weed 30 minutes ago abd im about to relapse soon
[9:16:46] <+bustatron_24> because he left them. show him they don't need him
[9:16:47] <OE_97> who do you think will win this tournament??
[9:16:50] <Foxyfluffy> Every time I see that hair I think, he better not have dyed that unironically
[9:17:27] <+ISpeirz> i personally think mousesports has a really good chance to win this tournament, with sk, c9 and faze line ups slightly rattled and with them playing extremely well online recently
[9:17:39] <timz8> I quit smoking like 2-3 months ago so I could join the army. Get sent to boot camp on Monday 😛
[9:18:00] <bobbydigital151> congrat bro
[9:18:05] <scoobyweed> ill go to army too thats why i stopped
[9:18:10] <Foxyfluffy> Enjoy not wackin' for a while
[9:18:12] <+elv1ss> yopu thing mousesports can win
[9:18:20] <timz8> Airborne ranger 👍 I can’t wait lol
[9:18:23] <trunks4210> well i guess i can see where ur coming from but doesn't he atleast deserves to be acknowledged as one of the greatest c9 players?????!!!!
[9:18:23] <+ISpeirz> i personally think they will beat sk
[9:18:32] <+elv1ss> na i'm from germany dont think so
[9:18:37] <bobbydigital151> where you from ???
[9:18:38] <wisearn> make love not war
[9:18:48] <scoobyweed> timz good choice boy .. lets hope there are no more world wars :D
[9:19:07] <+bustatron_24> he is one of the best c9 players but loyalty is big for me
[9:19:13] <timz8> Right lol. It’s sketchy rn w Russia but I guess we’ll see 😂
[9:19:32] <scoobyweed> yup .. im from bulgaria so we will be on fire too :D
[9:19:44] <trunks4210> did vladimir putin get re-elected?
[9:20:01] <+ISpeirz> i dont really see why stewie joined sk other than money
[9:20:03] <bobbydigital151> ww3 about to start so good luck
[9:20:05] <scoobyweed> is that a retoric question ? :D
[9:20:14] <+ISpeirz> sk have been in a stalemate for a while now and c9 just got going
[9:20:40] <Foxyfluffy> Stalemate?
[9:20:52] <Foxyfluffy> As in?
[9:21:00] <+ISpeirz> not doing too well
[9:21:11] <trunks4210> sk was going downhill and stewie joins a failing team i do not understand his choices he makes
[9:21:23] <+bustatron_24> money
[9:21:47] <scoobyweed> did the players take salary even if they lose tournaments ?
[9:21:54] <+bustatron_24> I hear automatic was going to go too

[9:38:05] <scoobyweed> yup
[9:38:05] <trunks4210> what happen to qbf??
[9:38:39] <flixije> FaZe will win anyway, wont be funny to watch at all :D
[9:38:51] <Dosiq> potnoe ebalo naf fla9
[9:39:07] <+H0r1blCS> would be funny if its 16:1 again
[9:39:17] <scoobyweed> do you think skins make you more motivated and sure on your powers to win games and play better ?
[9:39:41] <+Xelidan> yes :D
[9:39:42] <+H0r1blCS> skins = wins
[9:39:58] <flixije> @scoobyweed , the animation of knives, make some people play better. but in itself, it doesnt give u a better chance to win.
[9:39:58] <stasiek123456789> yap
[9:40:23] <scoobyweed> i think too .. but my motto in csgo is skins dont make skills .. but yes i think they help a lil bit
[9:40:39] <flixije> FaZe had a bad game yesterday. But today, Xizt know how to play with the team. Everything is new for him. So yeah.
[9:41:06] <Affxctive> Who got replaced on faze
[9:41:11] <+H0r1blCS> I hope Xizt fits in well.
[9:41:15] <stasiek123456789> but when u have d lore and write in ur nick *** u play like pasha biceps
[9:41:15] <pinkie2k> olof
[9:41:20] <+H0r1blCS> Olof is off for a bit
[9:41:20] <Affxctive> Why Olof
[9:41:25] <RZBD> olof but he had some personal problems or something like that
[9:41:27] <Affxctive> Y
[9:41:31] <Affxctive> Oh
[9:41:35] <flixije> Xizt was completely usless yesterday. If he plays like that. We can say gg at the moment.
[9:41:45] <trunks4210> olof wanted some personal time off
[9:41:45] <RZBD> he will come back in the team soon
[9:42:21] <+H0r1blCS> Xizt isnt on the team permanent, just a stand in pretty much

[9:51:00] <flixije> @chipskilIed FaZe is way better then them. But right now. Their communication is a little bit bad. Because of a replaced player, and etc.

[9:51:27] <persassyjackson10> nip or navi win this tournament
[9:51:48] <flixije> I think SK can be a strong team. With the players. But they shouldnt replace Stewie with Taco, they should've replaced Stewie with Boltz etc
