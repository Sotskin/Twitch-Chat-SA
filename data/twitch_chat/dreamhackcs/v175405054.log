[14:03:36] <likeamug> The old m4&ak compared to new sound like shit lol
[14:04:38] <unpluggedradiolink> I would raise so much money, just to have that old LDLC lineup back
[14:04:44] <likeamug> It's crazy how much better the teams are these days but sucks because these times were better because Csgo was starting to blow up, every event the game grew massively

[14:10:24] <unpluggedradiolink> THE COMEBACK BEGINS
[14:10:45] <Hampan32> i saw this live at dreamhack EleGiggle
[14:11:05] <unpluggedradiolink> so unreal man, how did ldlc manage this comeback
[14:11:31] <unpluggedradiolink> NIP t side was actually pretty garbage
[14:12:47] <topd0g2> and the arena wasnt even that big and its still loud af
[14:13:31] <unpluggedradiolink> yea swedish crowd was crazy - it is still today
[14:14:27] <unpluggedradiolink> dreamhack majors were always really cool

[14:17:52] <jerkq> This small crowd is louder than the crowd at ESL ONE NY
[14:19:23] <jerkq> Anders and Semmler <3
[14:20:02] <unpluggedradiolink> best casters, sad that they split up, even though for a short time
[14:20:19] <jerkq> yeap
[14:20:41] <jerkq> I mean the other guys are good too, but nobody beats these 2
[14:21:11] <unpluggedradiolink> true, the chemistry is just perfect
[14:21:22] <Polky_boss_13> live ?
[14:21:28] <unpluggedradiolink> and their voices are smooth and they dont annoy anyone
[14:21:29] <jerkq> Yeah, feels like theyre still the voice of csgo

[14:23:01] <unpluggedradiolink> "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?" - nobody beats that, not even "WHAT IN GODS NAME"

[14:23:47] <siretn> When did Smithz left G2?
[14:23:58] <jerkq> Hmm, Sadokist and Anders are very good combo too.. maybe even better.
[14:24:29] <official_tnkappa> old but gold.
[14:25:00] <unpluggedradiolink> SmithzZ never left, is just the coach now
[14:25:30] <siretn> Oh sh1t this is so old.
[14:25:52] <jerkq> This is so old but so gold
[14:26:05] <jerkq> 3 years bros... time flies
[14:26:05] <unpluggedradiolink> NIP at this moment is like: "Guys, we gonna win this, its 14-9" and LDLC like: "Nope"
[14:26:32] <jerkq> Yeah, this was hearbreaking
[14:27:12] <alekeiin> First Major i saw
[14:27:24] <alekeiin> Such a good final
[14:27:39] <alekeiin> Feels like yesterday
[14:27:53] <unpluggedradiolink> and the best one, imo thats one of the best finals ever played in csgo history
[14:27:56] <jerkq> Soon well all be old AF
[14:28:02] <+FreshW> ikr
[14:28:07] <jerkq> In our 60's
[14:28:17] <jerkq> gg
[14:28:46] <alekeiin> Yeah this final was incredible
[14:28:51] <Maaxsaaa> PowerUpL LUL PowerUpR
[14:29:33] <unpluggedradiolink> That overpass boost and the whole drama was entertaining af - such a good tournament
[14:29:39] <alekeiin> I remember after ldlc won d2 in the final almost everyone thought that ldlc Would win the second Map aswell
[14:30:05] <alekeiin> I miss these days
[14:30:09] <unpluggedradiolink> yea. but NIP magic strikes back
[14:30:19] <unpluggedradiolink> shox was a beast on d2
[14:30:21] <jerkq> This was a throw :D
[14:30:29] <alekeiin> Yeah
[14:30:45] <alekeiin> Fuck this retake
[14:30:55] <+FreshW> NiP is on the edge of coming back
[14:31:03] <alekeiin> NiP played it so bad :(
[14:31:20] <alekeiin> Its awesome to see
[14:31:34] <alekeiin> Lets hope they qualify for next major
[14:32:15] <alekeiin> NiP was very good with maikelele tbh
[14:32:27] <+FreshW> i m√¨ss friberg
[14:32:28] <unpluggedradiolink> I knew back than at exactly this moment, that it will go to overtime
[14:32:56] <alekeiin> And that they won starladder with maikelele as a stand-in was beautiful to see
[14:33:16] <alekeiin> Haha
[14:33:24] <Maaxsaaa> gg
[14:33:24] <unpluggedradiolink> I was so happy, but he stayed as a stand in
[14:33:36] <unpluggedradiolink> kindy sad
[14:33:40] <alekeiin> Y
[14:33:57] <alekeiin> Kio was so good
[14:34:30] <+m1tchh123> A site has well changed XD
[14:34:49] <alekeiin> I wonder how IT feels to play a match like this
[14:34:51] <jerkq> I agree, people were never hiped about him, but I always thought hes sick
[14:34:51] <unpluggedradiolink> VeryGames/LDLC (French) vs NIP rivalvry is in my opinion the best rivalvry we ve ever had in CSGO history
[14:35:04] <alekeiin> Yeah
[14:35:23] <Rosenqviist> ITS LIVE PogChamp
[14:35:30] <+FreshW> i liked the nip v fnatic days too
[14:35:39] <HoveringUmlaut> a site on old overpass was bad
[14:35:43] <alekeiin> But imagine doing some crazy play infront of a Big crowd
[14:35:51] <EVIL_AIM> It is finals ?
[14:35:51] <unpluggedradiolink> nowerdays there are no real rivalvrys, cause top5 shifting the whole time
[14:36:09] <alekeiin> Yeah csgo is actually much better rn
[14:36:10] <+FreshW> true
[14:36:27] <alekeiin> Overpass Nuke and Cobble so unbalanced
[14:36:37] <unpluggedradiolink> yea its life, twitch has a new technology which brings us back in time and in the moment we are in 2014
[14:36:42] <alekeiin> And the cz
[14:36:51] <FYCKEN> old nip <33
[14:37:00] <theLavajatan> who won?
[14:37:13] <alekeiin> Cs wasnt even that Big 2014
[14:37:26] <alekeiin> How many viewers during this final?
[14:37:38] <alekeiin> 300k?
[14:37:39] <FYCKEN> 5k
[14:37:48] <unpluggedradiolink> People can say what they want about the CZ, but it made everything much more tense and exciting, we had the feeling that a CZ forcebuy can shift the whole momentum
[14:37:50] <jerkq> 206000
[14:38:12] <alekeiin> Now its 1 million during the final
[14:38:12] <unpluggedradiolink> but objectivly it was op af
[14:38:29] <Sneraz> Who won?
[14:38:37] <jerkq> LDLC
[14:38:48] <unpluggedradiolink> LDLC, 15-19 somethin like that
[14:38:59] <alekeiin> Csgo is much more fun to watch rn tjo
[14:39:00] <Sneraz> Ahh
[14:39:06] <jerkq> I remember that it was close to the end?
[14:39:09] <alekeiin> Tho
[14:39:22] <alekeiin> Now theres no dominant teams
[14:39:34] <unpluggedradiolink> 16-19 sorry
[14:40:43] <unpluggedradiolink> is that pita as a coach?
[14:40:48] <alekeiin> Yeah
[14:41:17] <alekeiin> I miss the good old major finals
[14:41:22] <unpluggedradiolink> never noticed him, such a long time
[14:42:01] <unpluggedradiolink> i always noticed momanus, legendary ldlc coach, a real goof but he was actually pretty good
[14:42:12] <alekeiin> Do anyone in here remember g2s Lineup in Cluj napocca?
[14:42:42] <jerkq> When I came to the stream 30min ago the old sounds sounded so weird, now the new ones do KappaPride
[14:42:50] <alekeiin> Haha
[14:42:52] <unpluggedradiolink> yea jkaem, rain, maikelele, fox and dennis
[14:43:12] <alekeiin> Yeah Their run during that major was so Nice to ser
[14:43:29] <alekeiin> No One believed in them
[14:43:44] <alekeiin> Too bad they lost to envy in semi
[14:44:04] <alekeiin> They led 1-0
[14:44:30] <alekeiin> Then they Were 1 round away from 2-0 envy in the semi
[14:44:54] <alekeiin> But envy managed to comeback and won 2-1 :(
[14:45:13] <alekeiin> And wtf happend to jkaem
[14:45:23] <alekeiin> He was so good in Cluj
[14:45:40] <alekeiin> Yeah they Were pretty good

[14:46:32] <inflama3> harder than liquid? xD
[14:46:42] <alekeiin> Everyone believed in Tsm cuz NiP Were so bad during that time
[14:47:03] <FYCKEN> gg
[14:47:20] <alekeiin> WHAT 1v2 do u mean
[14:48:07] <alekeiin> I want to see NiP in a major in front of a Big crowd

[14:48:35] <alekeiin> Hahha yeah
[14:48:51] <alekeiin> Tsm was the masters of cooling
[14:49:04] <alekeiin> Choking
[14:49:23] <alekeiin> But its Nice to see karrigan winning again
[14:49:28] <Hampan32> he died

[14:53:35] <alekeiin> Why Cant dreamhack host Any majors
[14:53:57] <nuutaan> im in atlanta area and still havent been to dh
[14:54:00] <alekeiin> ESL have much better locations though
[14:54:19] <alekeiin> Dreamhack better produced tournaments
[14:54:53] <alekeiin> I Wanna see major in denmark or sweden
[14:55:04] <alekeiin> In Malmo or Stockholm
[14:55:05] <jerkq> !nextmatch
[14:55:16] <jerkq> What are they broadcasting next?
[14:55:16] <alekeiin> Or copenhagen
[14:55:30] <likeamug> It didn't matter what team played faze today maybe besides SK they would've got stomped just as bad as liquid did
[14:56:02] <jerkq> likeamug, my thoughts exactly
[14:56:03] <likeamug> @alekeiin they're having esl pro league finals in Denmark
[14:56:14] <jerkq> SK might have been able to fight back
[14:56:32] <likeamug> Even astralis would've got handled like that
[14:56:50] <likeamug> SK is the only team I can see beating faze when they play like that
[14:56:50] <alekeiin> Yeah thats lit likeamug
[14:57:06] <likeamug> I think it's in Odense
[14:57:11] <alekeiin> Not in Their current form
[14:58:18] <alekeiin> The Only team i see having a chance against Faze rn is G2
[14:58:25] <likeamug> Next big tourney isn't till oct 20th WutFace
[14:58:47] <likeamug> Nah g2 is overhyped they'll play like shit next tourney tbh
[14:58:57] <jerkq> Is there any majors left this year?
[14:59:00] <alekeiin> Well ELEAGUE group C and D during next 2 weekends
[14:59:16] <likeamug> They won one time in like 7 events and ppl saying they're insane is bs
[14:59:47] <alekeiin> But its good with a break cuz then Every team has a LOT of time to practice and play at Their fullest potential
[14:59:52] <likeamug> Although Kenny in peak form could stop faze but he hasn't played that way since cluj
[15:00:07] <alekeiin> You are right
[15:01:39] <alekeiin> What 3 teams Would be best at Their highest peak
