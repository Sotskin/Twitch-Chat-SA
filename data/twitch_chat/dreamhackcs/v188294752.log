[11:31:21] <+lePtitHitsu> SK
[11:32:41] <Simonsoft> sk are all about the tactics
[11:32:59] <Simonsoft> VP have awesome matches, but they have also shitty ones, SK is more Stable
[11:33:03] <+lePtitHitsu> watching the worlds it makes me want to play x)
[11:33:07] <Simonsoft> VP is more about individuals
[11:33:27] <+lePtitHitsu> sure
[11:33:35] <Lachota95> co to za turniej??
[11:33:39] <+lePtitHitsu> when we see 1v3 or more

[11:36:25] <Simonsoft> for reflexes
[11:36:47] <+lePtitHitsu> your a tactical watcher ;)
[11:37:03] <herdal20> SK is more about individuals dude
[11:37:15] <gezu96> ok
[11:37:39] <+lePtitHitsu> I haven't see a single round SK 1v3 or something liek that
[11:37:41] <Simonsoft> sk are tacticians, working like a single organism
[11:38:02] <herdal20> sk has players with amazing aim
[11:38:09] <gezu96> juste smoking CBD ez win match
[11:38:10] <herdal20> and game sense

[12:07:38] <heavyexistentialdread> just you
[12:07:48] <heavyexistentialdread> this is a RERUN
[12:08:15] <imercelus> why do people never read the tittle ;c
[12:08:21] <Panthur> When it's a live event you get tens of thousands watching
[12:08:41] <imercelus> csgo is still dying as an esport tho
[12:09:16] <sent9191> i mean i`ve seen all these recent tournaments live, and its nowhere near to what it was
[12:09:19] <+lePtitHitsu> an hour ago they put the 2014 dreamhack
[12:09:42] <heavyexistentialdread> maybe considered as a dead game but there are still so many viewers
[12:09:58] <herdal20> it's not even that dead lol
[12:10:04] <Simonsoft> cause many ppl have wooden PC's thats all
[12:10:37] <imercelus> shroud gets more viewers than dream hack maters live games
[12:10:59] <Simonsoft> PUBG > CS GO
[12:12:08] <heavyexistentialdread> I think PUBG is a bit casual to officially become esport

[1 day, 4:41:57] <Unpas> Rain!
[1 day, 4:42:31] <javygravy> yeah, i do still play it every once in a while but its not what it used to be
[1 day, 4:43:34] <pebbloss> @stingyptv lmao read title please
[1 day, 4:43:48] <Unpas> pubg? the 90% of the gametime consist of watching some streamer run around looking for gear and weapons and talking......nothing is more boring
[1 day, 4:44:32] <CulturalZeitgeist> It doesn't make for a great Esport experience
[1 day, 4:44:39] <zsoltikozm> I really hate PubG
[1 day, 4:45:01] <taxevasion101> > has razer headset
[1 day, 4:45:44] <Unpas> if you love growing old and dying while watching a game, pubg is for you
[1 day, 4:45:55] <Unpas> no action until you 80
[1 day, 4:47:39] <taxevasion101> i can see why some people might enjoy pubg and I saw potential in it when it first was released, but the devs have gone greedy and the game is still as bad
[1 day, 4:48:27] <taxevasion101> imagine a game running equally on a 4 thread vs 8 thread cpu
[1 day, 4:48:36] <taxevasion101> it's a joke
[1 day, 4:49:25] <zsoltikozm> PubG shared the CS's community and I don't know the peaople what like in that s...it game
[1 day, 4:50:28] <taxevasion101> I have fallen a little in love with CS again after a 1 year break
[1 day, 4:50:48] <taxevasion101> it's a good damn game in the end of the day.
[1 day, 4:51:37] <taxevasion101> sadly, the same story - if you're playing solo Q there's a very little chance you're getting out of silver
[1 day, 4:51:46] <taxevasion101> it's very team dependent
[1 day, 4:54:25] <Nis1337> yes and how they play
[1 day, 4:55:06] <zsoltikozm> Yes,the CS is really team dependent but the silver's don't have skill for this game in that level
[1 day, 4:56:15] <Nis1337> nope
[1 day, 4:56:51] <taxevasion101> it's really off putting to have to constantly deal with shitty teammates.
[1 day, 4:57:15] <taxevasion101> I mean, some lucky games I have gotten decent teammates where it wasn't a big deal if we lost
[1 day, 4:58:02] <taxevasion101> but when the teammates are so bad that you can't have the opportunity to play yourself you just give up on the game
[1 day, 4:58:34] <zsoltikozm> Yeah,I understand what you want to say
[1 day, 4:59:54] <taxevasion101> why are esport professionals so cringy in interviews lmao
[1 day, 5:00:34] <zsoltikozm> cringy? what it mean? :D
[1 day, 5:00:34] <taxevasion101> this one is fine
[1 day, 5:03:00] <taxevasion101> yeah, in interviews the vast majority of esport pros, specially non-native english ones reflect over the game really sloppy and boringly
[1 day, 5:03:14] <taxevasion101> akwardly
[1 day, 5:03:26] <taxevasion101> so bad it physically hurts hahahah
[1 day, 5:03:43] <taxevasion101> this one is surprisingly good
[1 day, 5:04:01] <zsoltikozm> I see on this player that he is really excited :D

[1 day, 9:08:32] <rekt6587> They are reruns
[1 day, 9:09:43] <DamiXcsgo> The old sounds was trash.
[1 day, 9:10:14] <frideil> well yeah but the new sounds when running/walking are not much better
[1 day, 9:11:00] <DamiXcsgo> Still better. Gun sounds is so more nice for your ear.
[1 day, 9:11:06] <Gutterm0uth> PogChamp
[1 day, 9:12:27] <DamiXcsgo> But I miss the movement when scoping with the AWP.
[1 day, 9:12:45] <DamiXcsgo> Thats the only reason why JW is not a good AWPer anymore
[1 day, 9:12:56] <frideil> you can still move and shoot if you crouch
[1 day, 9:13:10] <frideil> jump and insta crouch and you can shoot
[1 day, 9:13:40] <DamiXcsgo> I know, but you if played the game at that time it was so much easier.
[1 day, 9:13:52] <DamiXcsgo> When they nerfed it, they nerfed JW
[1 day, 9:14:18] <frideil> yeah i know but it's good they did the changes they did becues there were an awp master race and i did not like it xD
[1 day, 9:15:10] <DamiXcsgo> I didnt like it either, but it rly destroyed JW and he was my fav AWPer back then :(
[1 day, 9:15:19] <frideil> i like the working headphones they have xD
[1 day, 9:15:38] <DamiXcsgo> Also the old CZ was 2 fucking OP.
[1 day, 9:17:03] <frideil> i never liked JW. My fav was and still are Guardian as awper
[1 day, 9:17:44] <DamiXcsgo> I like more aggresive AWPers like kennyS. Guardian is way too passive for me.
[1 day, 9:18:18] <marcelalex22> what about Fallen?
[1 day, 9:18:26] <MoralMetal> brax best awp na PogChamp
[1 day, 9:19:03] <DamiXcsgo> Ska is 100% the best AWPer in NA
[1 day, 9:19:11] <MoralMetal> rip titan
[1 day, 9:19:21] <frideil> Fallen are the best Leader and everyone likes him but not the best awper
[1 day, 9:20:42] <DamiXcsgo> If we could mix Fallens IGL skill, kennyS' good aggresive style and Guardians passive style we would get 1.6 Markeloff
[1 day, 9:20:49] <DamiXcsgo> Jk
[1 day, 9:21:31] <Drifty45> guys im watching the stream in like 2fps, anything going on with twitch?

[1 day, 9:24:12] <marcelalex22> what do you reckon they will pull out?
[1 day, 9:24:22] <marcelalex22> nuke maybe?
[1 day, 9:24:38] <frideil> don't need to pull out anything
[1 day, 9:24:47] <frideil> they were 1 map short
[1 day, 9:25:12] <marcelalex22> ohhh
[1 day, 9:25:16] <frideil> yeah they did not play the old dust for like a month or more
[1 day, 9:25:48] <frideil> yeah and D2 was removed for some time so they were only 6?

[1 day, 9:29:29] <DamiXcsgo> Mods explain...
[1 day, 9:30:23] <DamiXcsgo> I hope they will take cbble out. Its rly not balanced
[1 day, 9:30:41] <frideil> The maps right now are Inferno, Train, Mirage, Nuke, cobble, Overpass, Cache
[1 day, 9:30:49] <DamiXcsgo> Ye
[1 day, 9:30:58] <DamiXcsgo> Out with cbble
[1 day, 9:31:30] <frideil> i would like to see Train removed
[1 day, 9:31:40] <DamiXcsgo> They already did train
[1 day, 9:31:50] <DamiXcsgo> so it will not be that
[1 day, 9:32:02] <Pootispo> cache or cobble
[1 day, 9:32:11] <marcelalex22> yeah most likely will be cobble
[1 day, 9:32:13] <Pootispo> more towards cobble
[1 day, 9:32:22] <frideil> yeah but i just don't like it! xD i think it's so boring to watch games on that map xD
[1 day, 9:32:23] <marcelalex22> players love cache
[1 day, 9:32:37] <DamiXcsgo> 80 % cbble, 10% mirage, 10% cache
[1 day, 9:32:37] <Pootispo> ik

[1 day, 9:34:14] <DamiXcsgo> Nah.
[1 day, 9:34:15] <frideil> train are 56% ct

[1 day, 9:35:52] <Pootispo> well nuke already got reworked nub
[1 day, 9:35:56] <DamiXcsgo> Nuke was 85-95% before tho
[1 day, 9:36:15] <DamiXcsgo> Train, Nuke, Inferno, Dust2 has been reworked.
[1 day, 9:36:38] <111lightning111> @DamiXcsgo Also cobble
[1 day, 9:36:52] <DamiXcsgo> No. @111lightning111
[1 day, 9:36:58] <frideil> i know but still! xDi am just watching the most unbalanced maps right now in the pool
[1 day, 9:37:03] <111lightning111> @DamiXcsgo Yes. U don't know.
[1 day, 9:37:09] <DamiXcsgo> It has been changed alot, but not reworked @111lightning111
[1 day, 9:37:16] <frideil> and the worst are Inf overpass and train
[1 day, 9:37:28] <frideil> and nuke
[1 day, 9:37:58] <DamiXcsgo> A rework is when they also change graphics.
[1 day, 9:38:36] <+TheBeamHero_> there are two types of rework lol
[1 day, 9:38:39] <DamiXcsgo> I played the old cbble. Its changed alot, but its not called a rework.
[1 day, 9:39:12] <+TheBeamHero_> game play rework, graphical rework enough said
[1 day, 9:39:28] <DamiXcsgo> Then mirage also had a rework if you think like that.
[1 day, 9:39:34] <frideil> oh shit we got a prime here boiiiiiss
[1 day, 9:40:25] <DamiXcsgo> But it didnt. Not like Valve make REWORKS. They made many fuckings changes but not an actual rework.
[1 day, 9:41:06] <+TheBeamHero_> yeah man the new dd2 is more like a remake cus it was built from scratch
[1 day, 9:41:56] <DamiXcsgo> Exactly.
[1 day, 9:42:22] <111lightning111> So fucking nice
[1 day, 9:42:23] <MyNameIsMatt> this is so old
[1 day, 9:43:01] <+unibrow_0> nearly 3 years man
[1 day, 9:43:06] <DamiXcsgo> I miss that smoke from ct to banana
[1 day, 9:43:11] <+TheBeamHero_> end of day its what ever valve say it is cus they own the game all more or less all the assets
[1 day, 9:43:14] <111lightning111> @CHIPzoom So old and good
[1 day, 9:43:24] <MyNameIsMatt> true
[1 day, 9:43:37] <DamiXcsgo> The game wasnt good back then tho
[1 day, 9:43:39] <MyNameIsMatt> the cz auto is og
[1 day, 9:43:59] <+TheBeamHero_> #bring back the cz?
[1 day, 9:44:06] <MyNameIsMatt> yea
[1 day, 9:44:30] <111lightning111> @DamiXcsgo It wasn't like "OMG SO FUCKING AMAZING" but pretty good, i think that the best year for cs go in 2015/start of 2016
[1 day, 9:44:40] <DamiXcsgo> CZ, Deagle, AWP was broken af. The sounds was shit. Graphics also. They rly did something to the game.
[1 day, 9:44:55] <+TheBeamHero_> true
[1 day, 9:45:15] <+unibrow_0> @DamiXcsgo But they could made it a bit faster
[1 day, 9:45:20] <MoralMetal> i miss the p250 sound though only change i really disliked
[1 day, 9:45:28] <+TheBeamHero_> all i want for the cz is an extra mag now days ....
[1 day, 9:45:35] <+unibrow_0> still waiting for new UI
[1 day, 9:45:49] <DamiXcsgo> @111lightning111 The game now is still better than in 2015/16. I know the sounds is shit rn but we just need to learn them. Just like the gun sounds.
[1 day, 9:45:49] <+TheBeamHero_> still waiting for source 2 ....
[1 day, 9:46:19] <MyNameIsMatt> its not gonna happen
[1 day, 9:46:48] <+TheBeamHero_> lol at this point its just as much meme as hl3 :D
[1 day, 9:46:53] <111lightning111> @DamiXcsgo Movement animationsa are better, graphics are better, but not gameplay in general and there is also a lot of hackers
[1 day, 9:46:56] <MyNameIsMatt> 2011 right?
[1 day, 9:47:18] <MyNameIsMatt> or is this 2012
