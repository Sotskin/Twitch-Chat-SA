[22:27:37] <ayush891000> yes.. so few viewers that made me think.. it cannot be live.. but thanks guys
[22:27:46] <IAmArchives> Olof has no armour rofl
[22:29:43] <ayush891000> guys when I am alone against 3 guys my heart start to beat so fast.. one time I clutched and won but my heart was beating so fast..
[22:30:07] <ayush891000> idk I try to control.. but it happens everytime..
[22:31:14] <JCMSAMA> play more
[22:31:47] <ayush891000> yes.. I need more experience.
[22:32:13] <JCMSAMA> by the time you can decently clutch certain situations your heartbeat wont beat so fast :)
[22:32:35] <JCMSAMA> or maybe you already can :)
[22:33:11] <ayush891000> clutches situations are so intense.. yes I hope that I become confident in facing such situations.
[22:33:14] <JonesDog> its a pretty neutral reaction when you are under pressure
[22:33:45] <zelthor123> @ayush891000 good luck bud
[22:33:57] <ayush891000> yes.. I have heard many people say this..that their heart starts beating so fast.
[22:34:05] <ayush891000> @zelthor123 thanks
[22:34:20] <JCMSAMA> it can be an advantage but also a disadvantage sometimes
[22:36:00] <zelthor123> Iâ€™ve played CS extensively and my heart did the same thing it doesnâ€™t anymore unless i am trying out for a new team or trying to impress a better player
[22:36:21] <JCMSAMA> ^
[22:36:24] <zelthor123> So it will stop with time
[22:36:37] <Hasinaa123> !time
[22:36:43] <Hasinaa123> time
[22:36:54] <JCMSAMA> @ayush891000 you can also be over alert so that is the disadvantage ;)
[22:37:10] <zelthor123> :p
[22:37:51] <JCMSAMA> and keep on watching these streams and learn :)
[22:37:53] <zelthor123> Just donâ€™t act like itâ€™s the end of the world when it comes down to it itâ€™s just a game
