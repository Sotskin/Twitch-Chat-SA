[0:50:53] <Gomito> ahhh
[0:51:03] <innerFire7> Can someone explain to me why this Dreamhack is considered Major, but the previous one in Malmo is not? Or is it? What makes a tournament Major?
[0:51:12] <Gomito> ya me parecía qe sean tan pocos spects
[0:51:29] <+Ab3Th3Mud0k0n12> valve sponsored I believe is what makes it a major
[0:51:36] <slexi1one111> idiottas iz nat live
[0:51:58] <adrujas> iz nat live
[0:52:06] <JuliiusK> Damn just got 4 ads
[0:52:12] <adrujas> xD
[0:52:14] <innerFire7> Well I knew that, but if Valve sponsored it wouldn't be drops and items?
[0:52:31] <slexi1one111> enigma iz shit
[0:54:39] <+BFG_WinstonSmith> lol this is not a major, by any means what so ever
[0:55:56] <innerFire7> Ppl spamed that it is when it was live - that's why I am askin.
[0:56:41] <innerFire7> I got confused, cuz I don't think this is a major. PGL was major cuz VOlvo was involved here I don't see drops or anything connecting it to volvo
[0:56:46] <RALF2strong> wait this isnt live
[0:57:20] <OfficialcHrispy> What? It says live
[0:57:55] <Radltune137> it says rerun
[0:57:56] <innerFire7> When will ppl learn to read and understand the meaning of the word "RERUN" FailFish
[0:58:18] <+Ab3Th3Mud0k0n12> "it says live" yes the stream is live, however the match is a rerun
[0:58:48] <Thrashface> every single time I have tuned into a rerun it is always people arguing about it being live or not lmao
[0:59:12] <+Ab3Th3Mud0k0n12> I know right, @thrashface
[0:59:17] <Fac3ts> live?
[0:59:17] <+BFG_WinstonSmith> yeah, only 2 majors this year, eleague and PGL both valve sponsored
[0:59:21] <innerFire7> because ppl who can actually use their grey matter are annoyed by ppl who cant BloodTrail
[0:59:44] <+Ab3Th3Mud0k0n12> "title says rerun, match must be live right now then" Kappa
[0:59:57] <Thrashface> lmao
[1:00:34] <innerFire7> Yeah also look at the viewers count - if it was live it would've had thousands more FailFish
[1:04:01] <BrunoSardine_> quality is awful for a life major

[6:28:04] <B1uesun_v7> @iboxingpower123 sorry dont have chat open all the time.
[6:28:39] <xPokeyyyy> Nekiz 0-19 LUL
[6:28:54] <B1uesun_v7> @iboxingpower123 tarik is a super smart player. That "peanut brain" meme is bs. He did pretty well as an IGL in OpTic with what he was given
[6:29:10] <cheatzexe> ^
[6:31:21] <cheatzexe> i don't see dazed playing at the level he once was at brax is still nuts and has already been used as a stand in for c9
[6:32:17] <cheatzexe> friberg was going to come in alone before the optic offer but one of the factors was "na blood"
[6:32:45] <cheatzexe> tarik and rush became available and they jumped on the deal i imagine they were a package deal
[6:34:08] <+iBoxingPower123> WHAT
[6:34:29] <B1uesun_v7> In an interview i think they said they both did dealings on their own, dont think they were a package

[7:31:17] <+iBoxingPower123> @TateScape I don't know, the cases look dope
[7:31:22] <peradd> what do you think about alienware laptops then? compared to other laptops
[7:31:44] <+iBoxingPower123> @TateScape But they don't have glass sidepanels
[7:31:57] <+iBoxingPower123> @fixmein45 Terrible
[7:32:32] <peradd> why and what is better in your opinion?
[7:35:06] <Sel_Gaming> @Froffsy This is a rerun I hope youre not serious and @iBoxingPower123 are you saying that alienware desktops are good? hahaha
[7:35:10] <+iBoxingPower123> @fixmein45 If you are dropping that much on a laptop, and are going to use it for a decent amount of gaming, go wiht Razer
[7:35:11] <clownpage> 0 kills lul
[7:35:57] <+iBoxingPower123> @Sel_Gaming No, I'm saying they are trash
[7:36:19] <Sel_Gaming> Oh thank god I'd be so sad if anyone still thinks they are good
[7:36:33] <Sel_Gaming> They are fine for someone who doesn't know anything about building a computer I guess though
[7:37:07] <+iBoxingPower123> @Sel_Gaming They are so overpriced it's sad. And if you don't know about building a computer, you should just use Cyberpower
[7:37:53] <+iBoxingPower123> @Sel_Gaming But even if, it's so easy to build one. Just watch a video
[7:38:25] <Sel_Gaming> Yeah agreed there are just so many better ways to go about it, alienware is like Nike. They just use the name of the brand to over price everything
[7:39:20] <+iBoxingPower123> @Sel_Gaming *Looks to left* Has 2 pairs of Nike shoes
[7:40:31] <Sel_Gaming> Honestly same here though we all are pulled into branding because it's an established name that we know
[7:40:48] <+iBoxingPower123> @Sel_Gaming Very true
[7:40:57] <Sel_Gaming> I'm a marketing major so I could go on about this forever haha
[7:41:47] <+iBoxingPower123> @Sel_Gaming Please no, my sister is in marketing at home advisor
