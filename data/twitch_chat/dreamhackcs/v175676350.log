[23:28:20] <Slowiee> I think G2 won malmo
[23:28:23] <SPAC3R95> thx
[23:28:37] <Reenzer> I want Swag-iwnl to play for C9
[23:28:59] <Slowiee> Don't think that's happening any time soon
[23:29:25] <Reenzer> sadly but yea not soon
[23:29:48] <Intus41> dint they had him as standin befor?
[23:29:55] <Reenzer> yea
[23:30:17] <Reenzer> he did pretty well because you can use him on all tactics
[23:30:22] <Intus41> so there must be a reason they choosed tarik and rush
[23:30:41] <Slowiee> But he's on the team with DaZeD, AZK and such
[23:30:42] <Reenzer> I think he benched him self to train more
[23:30:45] <Minakiss> shroud sucks hes retiring
[23:30:50] <NorMinyLaus> fak dat
[23:30:50] <rodrigochilipeppers> JAIL SWAG
[23:31:04] <Intus41> think they using synergy btween rush and tarik , since they know each other good
[23:31:21] <Reenzer> @slowiee IBP is not that team anymore
[23:32:12] <Reenzer> @minakiss i think you never watched shroud :/
[23:32:19] <rodrigochilipeppers> there is no possibility of valve desbanir swag. If she does, she loses respect.
[23:32:30] <rodrigochilipeppers> unbanned*
[23:32:35] <Reenzer> he is unbanned
[23:32:44] <rodrigochilipeppers> from esl
[23:32:51] <Reenzer> yea
[23:32:56] <rodrigochilipeppers> he can't play in majors
[23:33:02] <Reenzer> true
[23:33:12] <Reenzer> but Dreamhack is no major
[23:33:26] <Intus41> dreamhack is actually
[23:33:33] <rodrigochilipeppers> the valve needs to maintain credibility. can not falicitar to those who act in the wrong way.
[23:33:43] <rodrigochilipeppers> dreamhack no major, yes
[23:33:53] <Intus41> i mean they deserve bann´s anyways
[23:34:16] <rodrigochilipeppers> but only small org will hire a player who can not play majors
[23:34:28] <rodrigochilipeppers> sorry for bad english
[23:34:37] <Reenzer> I say swag deserved that ban but iff they didn't ban him he was now probably the best Na player
[23:35:15] <TeaNinja> yep match fixing is pretty shitty
[23:35:18] <Intus41> guys , dreamhack is powered by valve , and is clearly fuckijng major
[23:35:51] <Reenzer> @intus41 Swag-iwnl got banned from tournaments he can play competitive
[23:36:11] <Reenzer> and Swag-iwnl dominated competitive and rank S
[23:36:27] <Intus41> he kinda did some time befor
[23:36:43] <Intus41> best braxx was still 1.6

[23:49:14] <rodrigochilipeppers> skadoodlo was part of IBP, he was not banned because he did not know what his teammates had done?
[23:49:29] <rodrigochilipeppers> skadoodle*
[23:51:06] <+skooteremu> yes
[23:51:38] <Intus41> nah
[23:52:02] <Intus41> he did know , he throwed aswell, valve couldnt see any skins commin in at his account
[23:52:48] <Intus41> so he didnt got banned , but he match fixed aswell, but didnt got payed yet , lucky boy
[23:54:05] <rodrigochilipeppers> was lucky then. valve said the ban is permanent ...
[1 day, 0:00:48] <+skooteremu> it isn't permanent
[1 day, 0:01:04] <+skooteremu> it was 2 years
[1 day, 0:01:22] <Intus41> it was permament , just esl decided to unbann
