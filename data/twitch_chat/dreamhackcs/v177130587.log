[14:11:11] <Timmy_Tryhard> ZakCS_ why allah out of all the choices? :O
[14:11:33] <ZakCS_> because ummmmmmmmmm yes
[14:13:05] <ZakCS_> i still use the suppressed m4 idk why everyone hates it
[14:13:40] <Timmy_Tryhard> ZakCS_ so do i, thinking about changing over tho, only because of the ammo cap
[14:14:25] <ZakCS_> I changed over a while because In the rank I'm in everyone's toxic over the m4's but I really don't like it
[14:14:39] <ZakCS_> Most people are**
[14:14:42] <EthanTheDabbingBaller> @ZakCS_ I personally use the m4a4 1) the ammo, 2) I like the skins better (lol) and 3) I feel like I'm more accurate with the m4a4
[14:14:57] <Timmy_Tryhard> ZakCS_ every rank has toxic people man :) just get over it XD
[14:15:26] <Timmy_Tryhard> EthanTheDabbingBaller biggest reason im considering the a4 is because my positioning always puts me in the crosshairs of the push xD
[14:15:41] <Timmy_Tryhard> and i ALWAYS run out of ammo for the spray :(
[14:15:43] <EthanTheDabbingBaller> @Nyere88 lol

[1 day, 7:13:42] <RXNJoescencE> Rip gg
[1 day, 7:13:57] <RXNJoescencE> Guns v eco it's over
[1 day, 7:14:19] <bot_biel> north its pretty weak
[1 day, 7:14:31] <RXNJoescencE> They haven't been playing serious
[1 day, 7:14:53] <RXNJoescencE> Konfig's play style is way more PUGish than he usually would play. They're going for highlights
[1 day, 7:15:11] <bot_biel> almost losing for a amateur team
[1 day, 7:15:15] <Aguspung> just watch this guishorro round
[1 day, 7:15:18] <RXNJoescencE> Same with the others but him in particular
[1 day, 7:15:34] <Aguspung> They are not amateur dude.
[1 day, 7:15:38] <RXNJoescencE> Lol
[1 day, 7:15:54] <RXNJoescencE> They're not amateur they're just not amazing
[1 day, 7:15:58] <bot_biel> compared to others
[1 day, 7:16:07] <RXNJoescencE> That's not what matters
[1 day, 7:16:13] <bot_biel> even cry9 is better
[1 day, 7:16:23] <Aguspung> They live in eeuu in a gaming house and work every day . So they are profesionals , maybe not the best :P
[1 day, 7:16:57] <RXNJoescencE> Honestly if north played this match textbook it'd be a blowout
[1 day, 7:17:03] <bot_biel> its over
[1 day, 7:17:32] <bot_biel> even liquid can destroy that team
[1 day, 7:17:36] <RXNJoescencE> In matches against teams that are shit compared to you you try new things
[1 day, 7:17:48] <RXNJoescencE> Like right there
[1 day, 7:17:59] <RXNJoescencE> They lost for frag hunting that they wouldn't otherwise do
[1 day, 7:18:13] <Aguspung> " even liquid" you mean the 6 rankd best team?
[1 day, 7:18:25] <Aguspung> and north is the 3 best team
