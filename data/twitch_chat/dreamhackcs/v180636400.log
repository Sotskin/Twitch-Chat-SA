[1 day, 0:21:38] <belaya_smert> @Official_craft1k no look major semi final 400 viewers-> dead game
[1 day, 0:22:18] <DamiXcsgo> Maybe its only 400 viewers because its 2 years old? @belaya_smert
[1 day, 0:22:40] <belaya_smert> haha triggered?
[1 day, 0:23:31] <belaya_smert> @Cunnett sure, valve will inform shroud when they working on something new. they give a fuck on shroud
[1 day, 0:23:59] <belaya_smert> you all should grow up....
[1 day, 0:25:02] <Cunnett> Wh you even here if it's a dead game?
[1 day, 0:25:16] <DamiXcsgo> You should grow up. You are the guy who dont listen even tho we have been telling you the same thing in 10 mins.
[1 day, 0:25:32] <Cunnett> Haha
[1 day, 0:25:48] <Cunnett> Someone else agrees with me
[1 day, 0:25:54] <belaya_smert> haha triggered! xD
[1 day, 0:26:17] <pirato> CS isn't dead because a pro player left
[1 day, 0:26:36] <pirato> its like saying "oh, someone has quit working at mcdonalds. FAST FOOD IS DYING"
[1 day, 0:26:42] <Cunnett> Exactly
[1 day, 0:26:56] <zuoyofei1> who left??/
[1 day, 0:27:06] <pirato> shrode
[1 day, 0:27:11] <Cunnett> Shroud
[1 day, 0:27:15] <belaya_smert> haha nice, exactly the reaction i have searched for
[1 day, 0:27:22] <zuoyofei1> but why
[1 day, 0:27:22] <Cunnett> He's still with c9 tho
[1 day, 0:27:43] <pirato> he doesn't want to compete anymore
[1 day, 0:27:54] <Cunnett> What a sad life you live searching for reactions @belaya_smert
[1 day, 0:27:57] <zuoyofei1> cause he can;t get a champion?
[1 day, 0:28:06] <0rhythm> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1 day, 0:28:11] <+LeYellowKing> Baguette vs Baguette ?
[1 day, 0:28:17] <belaya_smert> who cares about shroud he is a stupid, he reached nothing in cs go
[1 day, 0:28:27] <0rhythm> not really that's old g2
[1 day, 0:28:43] <belaya_smert> @Cunnett when you are older you will understand
[1 day, 0:29:05] <0rhythm> whiny little b****
[1 day, 0:29:22] <0rhythm> shroud is
[1 day, 0:29:30] <Cunnett> @belaya_smert he's stupid yet got 33k subs.
[1 day, 0:30:21] <Cunnett> And when I get older I will understand well no because I won't be sad searching for reaction on a CSGO stream @belaya_smert Sad sad sad life you live
[1 day, 0:31:35] <pirato> esports has recently become a billion dollar industry. that is predicted to triple in the coming years. cs definitely isn't dead
[1 day, 0:31:37] <belaya_smert> oh guys xD you got the view of a little child on this things. he didnt won a single major.
[1 day, 0:31:55] <DamiXcsgo> lul?
[1 day, 0:32:25] <Cunnett> @belaya_smert so because of that he's stupid? Haha you're comments are laughable
[1 day, 0:32:30] <storie_cpt> is it really all bout winning majors? dont htink so... think about it
[1 day, 0:32:55] <pirato> old inferno looks more clunky than I remember it
[1 day, 0:33:41] <belaya_smert> @storie_cpt so its about making money? xD
[1 day, 0:33:49] <DamiXcsgo> Just because he didnt win a major, he was bad? Nice way of thinking. NiKo is one of the best players in the world, but he hasnt won a major.
[1 day, 0:34:49] <Cunnett> @belaya_smert he's earns more money than any CSGO player can dream of. You have no argument.
[1 day, 0:35:03] <belaya_smert> @Official_craft1k but he stays and try to. not like shourd....."im gonna quit because i make enough money" later he will regret to quit
[1 day, 0:35:22] <pirato> not really lol
[1 day, 0:35:46] <pirato> 30k subs = a lot of money
[1 day, 0:36:04] <pirato> he's still getting paid by c9 as a streamer too
[1 day, 0:36:08] <DamiXcsgo> @belaya_smert That not why he quit? HAHA... He thought that it was boring to be a pro player, and he enjoyed streaming, so why dont do what you love.
[1 day, 0:36:10] <belaya_smert> Little kids man. all about money. you have a lot more to learn in life
[1 day, 0:36:34] <pirato> I like how you immediately go to calling us little kids
[1 day, 0:36:43] <Cunnett> @belaya_smert you literally have no idea! I'm going to stop segueing with you now because it's like educating a brick wall.
[1 day, 0:36:50] <DarkAbsoult> @belaya_smert Emotions can't be bought
[1 day, 0:37:10] <Cunnett> Lol
[1 day, 0:37:37] <pirato> perhaps shroud stopped liking cs? or competing in it? I simply made the point that he won't regret the salary even after leaving pro cs
[1 day, 0:37:39] <belaya_smert> education also
[1 day, 0:38:08] <Cunnett> He earns more now than what he did playing CSGO pro
[1 day, 0:38:30] <belaya_smert> @gamerPirato regret the salary...... thats the answer i expected.....
[1 day, 0:39:47] <Cunnett> He had 4K subs while playing CSGO pro since going to PUBG he's got 33.2k subs
[1 day, 0:39:54] <DamiXcsgo> Its not about the money. He didnt like to play CS at a pro level anymore, and he loves to stream. So ofcause he choose to stream.
[1 day, 0:40:00] <belaya_smert> go to school and get some education recommendation from me
[1 day, 0:40:00] <@Moobot> The desk consist of @Stunna , @LiquidPimpZ & @HazedCS
[1 day, 0:40:29] <Cunnett> @belaya_smert you really are dumb
[1 day, 0:40:42] <belaya_smert> @Cunnett not really
