[0:11:16] <davskal> Zeus looks so young lol
[0:11:16] <saidkozal> thanks for the nostalgia
[0:11:25] <intersect82> @davskal its not the headshot mechanics,it's the hitboxes,they were bigger then the head of the player that's why everyone used huge crosshairs
[0:11:37] <roman_grace> A RUSSKIE COMMENTATORY?
[0:11:38] <juancamusso> cs 1.6 is better than csgo
[0:11:44] <roman_grace> ESTY?
[0:11:53] <intersect82> now in cs go,hitboxes are way better then in css and cs 1.6
[0:12:12] <saidkozal> thorin was a commentator LUL LUL
[0:12:29] <davskal> csgo is the least flawed game in the history, there are literally no problems in that game functional-wise
[0:12:41] <lycka96> still think the movement fluidity in 1.6 was better idk why
[0:13:00] <davskal> source had the best movement, bhops were op
[0:13:05] <intersect82> @davskal you are 100% correct my friend
[0:13:14] <falconeo> 1.6 and go are both great I think
[0:13:20] <intersect82> but still cs 1.6 was huge fun
[0:13:24] <DONJANKO1337> live or rerun
[0:13:36] <falconeo> Title
[0:13:38] <officialvenezio> rerun
[0:13:41] <lycka96> but pro scene wise, 1.6 was miles better
[0:13:45] <DONJANKO1337> ty
[0:13:55] <intersect82> yeah
[0:14:09] <officialvenezio> idk im so bad at CSGO but im ok in 1.6
[0:14:18] <saidkozal> is that karrigan CmonBruh
[0:14:22] <lycka96> i remember playing semi-pro games in source, it was super shit
[0:14:29] <infinite__escape> because hitboxes are smaller in csgo
[0:14:33] <saidkozal> cmonBruh
[0:14:51] <raavenzz> this fucking legendaryt
[0:14:55] <intersect82> @officialvenezio cs go is a lot harder
[0:14:56] <officialvenezio> i mean i am global but i cant aim for shit
[0:14:58] <saidkozal> im a god in 1.6 but absolute horseshit in go
[0:15:05] <falconeo> Kerrigan hasn’t changed from my eyes
[0:15:11] <davskal> too bad valve didn't add matchmaking to 1.6 some time ago, if it had like 20k players it would be fantastic, same for source
[0:15:53] <intersect82> yeeah i just use to play on random servers
[0:16:00] <lycka96> valve never sponsored 1.6 tournaments right?
[0:16:14] <davskal> i think so yes
[0:16:15] <tirgata> right
[0:16:28] <lycka96> theres your answer then
[0:16:32] <intersect82> I think they only sponsored majors,just like in cs go
[0:16:49] <lycka96> i mean, when go was shown, LOL was 1,5 years old
[0:17:05] <lycka96> esports as they were now didnt exist
[0:17:15] <lycka96> so no real threat to valves IP
[0:17:21] <officialvenezio> anyone who wanna play csgo with me? lol
[0:17:28] <davskal> tbh if we saw some 2012 csgo our minds would be blown the same way, it was a completely different game back then
[0:17:36] <+SaKePS> i am silver 3 officialvenezio i can play
[0:17:37] <intersect82> what's your rank?

[0:31:51] <hundknullaren> god I miss russian jump
[0:31:57] <intersect82> when volvo was making cs go they asked pro players how to make it balanced and esport ready and that's why cs go replaced 1.6
[0:32:02] <ChaosZ> those times when u can crouch infinitely unlike now the charas cant even crouch a lot
[0:32:11] <dash3t> markeloff :(
[0:32:30] <Reikuun> volvo? lol

[0:35:22] <Dzigator> Best in 1.6 at the time? Spawn or HeatoN
[0:35:23] <+SirReLax> Depends on the timeperiod @intersect82 At the end Markeloff was maybe the sickest awp in 1.6
[0:35:31] <@unfunsLife> True Markeloff
[0:35:37] <Dzigator> Spawn invented shit everyone used later
[0:35:45] <hsnylmz> year 2012 navi lose year 2017 navi lose again LUL

[0:35:53] <intersect82> i know he was best awper,but in general
[0:35:57] <comuniou> fuck i never heard of spawn xD
[0:36:05] <mveedee> Luk

[10:26:48] <rautarier> NiP <3
[10:27:48] <+verninja> this was the olofpass quater final between ldlc and fnatic afaik
[10:27:58] <+verninja> the tournament, where that happened i mean
[10:29:19] <BestFriendVenom> Wait this is the olofpass match
[10:29:36] <+verninja> no, obviously this is nip vs ldlc
[10:29:36] <BestFriendVenom> Did that happen on this stream or not yet
[10:29:55] <zojr___________> lma oand it was overpass not inferno
[10:29:57] <BestFriendVenom> Oh
[10:30:00] <+verninja> just saying to get to this point, ldlc had to face fnatic, where the olofpass boost happened
[10:30:23] <BestFriendVenom> TBH I'm not really all that great when it comes to professional CSGO
[10:30:29] <BestFriendVenom> Wow
[10:31:14] <zojr___________> this setup is so cool playing in the middle of the whole crowd like that

[10:42:50] <ProSe_x> Its fun to see when nip actually was the best
[10:43:02] <+verninja> i doubt you played the old cobble if you say that
[10:43:20] <jermztwitch> i loved the old de_cbble

[10:43:42] <jermztwitch> i also liked cs_thunder tho sooooo
[10:43:47] <jermztwitch> my opinion may not matter
[10:43:47] <raka_gg> 2014 ?
[10:43:59] <ProSe_x> what gave it away, the title?
[10:44:07] <+verninja> with the tower in ct middle and the far end b site? that version was really dumb
[10:44:12] <jermztwitch> 2014 matters --Jermz
[10:44:43] <jermztwitch> lol the mid tower for ct's

[1 day, 9:30:25] <nickg0203> ???
[1 day, 9:30:26] <Litty2Tity> hi
[1 day, 9:31:04] <willfunkyouup> if...if G2 took the OT, G2 would have had a high chance of taking a major. first for norway and portugal
[1 day, 9:31:09] <TawTheFett> did inferno get updated?
[1 day, 9:31:27] <willfunkyouup> hi you must be new to cs
[1 day, 9:31:35] <+green_6> ^
[1 day, 9:31:58] <chupamoslena> @willfunkyouup that auto noob kill the game i remember this game
[1 day, 9:34:24] <willfunkyouup> rain deserved that major so hard
[1 day, 9:35:14] <+green_6> damn KennyS got some chapped lips
[1 day, 9:35:21] <chupamoslena> i think if g2 won this game they would take the major,they only need one round that would be beautiful
[1 day, 9:35:58] <willfunkyouup> even fox deserved it... even thou his form dropped so dramatically
[1 day, 9:35:59] <chupamoslena> @green_6 great lips for...... Kappa
[1 day, 9:36:44] <zvinte> banana
[1 day, 9:37:43] <imitationchamber> PogChamp
[1 day, 9:39:02] <willfunkyouup> I just never understood how after the major, their form dropped so hard.
[1 day, 9:40:06] <willfunkyouup> at the time, they were a solid top 6 team. maybe a little optimistic
[1 day, 9:41:11] <imitationchamber> @willfunkyouup People studied the way they have played
[1 day, 9:41:36] <imitationchamber> They got used to happy lurking and envy pushing smokes
[1 day, 9:42:12] <chupamoslena> d
[1 day, 9:42:22] <bourras_HS> xD Envyus
[1 day, 9:43:07] <chupamoslena> i think every team have good and bad moments,only fnatic dominates cs go,they were like top 4 in every tournament for 1.5 year
[1 day, 9:43:54] <imitationchamber> @chupamoslena Luminosity/sk hello
[1 day, 9:43:56] <chupamoslena> and when g2 drop the team they never played like before
[1 day, 9:44:16] <willfunkyouup> the feeling of being a loyal fan to G2 compared to FaZe now are just so different
[1 day, 9:44:35] <willfunkyouup> probably due to the makilele vibe
[1 day, 9:45:14] <imitationchamber> Kio was the problem 4Head
[1 day, 9:45:36] <chupamoslena> @imitationchamber sk its like they second most dominate team,fnatic had a really gold era ,they won almost every thing
[1 day, 9:45:49] <1IMxEtEr94> foxgod
[1 day, 9:46:33] <willfunkyouup> ayy auto wall goes down
[1 day, 9:46:34] <F2OSTX> rain form faze ?
[1 day, 9:46:44] <chupamoslena> @willfunkyouup its just sad that maik leave the team dignitas,i was so happy when i saw maik fox and jkaem again together
[1 day, 9:46:55] <chupamoslena> @F2OSTX yes
[1 day, 9:47:22] <willfunkyouup> he didnt rlly form faze. more like just stuck around with the project
[1 day, 9:47:29] <1IMxEtEr94> its a pós game boys

[1 day, 9:47:56] <F2OSTX> ty
[1 day, 9:49:16] <willfunkyouup> rain's form was a big surprise for me, since he was solid all the way back to early 2015. he's so consistent.
[1 day, 9:49:19] <chupamoslena> i guess im not seeing fox and jkaem in a major for the next years
[1 day, 9:49:59] <willfunkyouup> @chupamoslena or ever...
[1 day, 9:50:02] <chupamoslena> @willfunkyouup the biggest surprise for me was rain and jkaem performance
[1 day, 9:50:25] <imitationchamber> gg
[1 day, 9:50:43] <willfunkyouup> god damn this moment broke me down at the time.
[1 day, 9:50:54] <chupamoslena> sad but true,even nip are struggling to go to amajor
[1 day, 9:51:03] <hultentv> I miss maikel so much, getting tilted that teams keep kciking him when he is one of the best
[1 day, 9:51:17] <willfunkyouup> COD Faze fans will never understand this.
[1 day, 9:51:31] <chupamoslena> at this moment i knew g2 are eliminated,1 round away from a major final :(
[1 day, 9:52:06] <chupamoslena> @hultentv i didnt understand the kick from nip roster
[1 day, 9:52:41] <willfunkyouup> the only reason i stuck around with being a faze fan was the history of the project. i now know what it feels like to be a nip fan.
[1 day, 9:53:39] <mgilin> you boys are taking it way to serios
[1 day, 9:53:56] <willfunkyouup> i am aware of tht XD
[1 day, 9:54:18] <mgilin> 😂😂😂well thats a one good thing haha
[1 day, 9:54:18] <willfunkyouup> it's the sense of belonging that makes me feel this way
[1 day, 9:54:21] <chupamoslena> now the only team i truly support its vp and wherever fox plays,i give up on nip they dont give a fuc* about their fans
[1 day, 9:54:36] <sleepaum> grill
[1 day, 9:54:40] <chupamoslena> #ASAAKIRA
[1 day, 9:54:52] <mgilin> well vp is the only team that hasnt changed
[1 day, 9:55:19] <mgilin> it like nv without kenny
[1 day, 9:55:32] <mgilin> or fanatic with new players
[1 day, 9:55:42] <mgilin> that fucking suck..
[1 day, 9:56:01] <chupamoslena> i like them,they are always legends no matter what
[1 day, 9:56:37] <chupamoslena> i didnt rly like fantic because i was a nip fanboy
[1 day, 9:57:12] <chupamoslena> fnatic vs nip=barca vs real
[1 day, 9:57:23] <willfunkyouup> rmb new csgo fans, take a bit of your time to learn about the scene's history, instead of listening to what ppl say at face value.
[1 day, 9:57:52] <nickg0203> another time?
