[4:05:36] <shiba_inus> oof
[4:09:28] <Azalot> how it comes the casters always knows better when to take a timeout than the team coach?
[4:25:42] <+jasonacejack> what's up üêß
[4:26:24] <+jasonacejack> good match. means the winner goes bezerk
[4:43:11] <+jasonacejack> NA calebDuck
[4:45:30] <Azalot> both teams not playing strong
[4:45:52] <+jasonacejack> Yeah =^)
[4:45:59] <Azalot> but ye NA is a joke LUL
[4:48:34] <Azalot> 2 out of 3 isnt every shot either
[4:49:07] <Azalot> what an idiot
[4:49:33] <Azalot> i should be in LDLC man ez carry

[4:51:12] <Azalot> caster such a CeRq fan
[4:51:38] <korolyan> mcaT mcaT mcaT mcaT mcaT mcaT
[4:52:41] <Azalot> if these casters would play csgo professional, easy majors
[4:52:43] <JakeTooTall> lol mad awp skills though
[4:52:48] <Azalot> they know everything better :O
[4:53:13] <JakeTooTall> they think they do haha
[4:53:46] <Azalot> just doin their job actually, but it triggers me a bit ^^
[4:54:07] <Azalot> casters vs pros.
[4:54:16] <Azalot> would be awesome 1 time
[4:54:16] <JakeTooTall> sometimes yeah itd be interesting for that to happen though
[4:54:44] <JakeTooTall> they could get whooped unless they have played pro before
[4:55:46] <Azalot> yea they have good game knowledge but wont win a single aim fight :D
[4:56:12] <JakeTooTall> haha at least theyll knopw what happened!
[4:56:48] <Azalot> but hey, they make usage of economical and timeouts just perfect. maybe thatll make the difference
[4:57:03] <JakeTooTall> need to get on csgo again, been a few days since i played last! could possibly bag them a win
[4:58:22] <JakeTooTall> nrg pulling back well after losing 1st game so close too!
[4:58:24] <Azalot> i would love to play semi pro, but its hard to get into it when u are a bit older and have to work all day :(
[4:58:49] <Azalot> yea nice comebacks
[4:59:09] <JakeTooTall> ah yeah i know the feeling! a game or 2 of an evening is my fix as long as pubg doesnt get involved haha
[4:59:37] <Azalot> pubg = 20 min. loot then kill 3 or 4
[4:59:45] <Azalot> LUL
[5:00:07] <JakeTooTall> haha if i get that far! sometimes pick the wrong spot to land but its great fun
