[3:38:28] <ThatLitDJ> bro
[3:38:48] <ThatLitDJ> you said you're silver 3... anyone on G2 can destroy you with an awp with eyes closed
[3:39:09] <+tronan_fex> ... duh, Mr. Obvious
[3:39:55] <+tronan_fex> doesnt take away from the fact that heni wrecks any G2 awp, even if ur global elite anyone on G2 would destroy you, and it says ur silver 5 lolo
[3:40:20] <ThatLitDJ> im LEM
[3:40:40] <+tronan_fex> LOLO! why does ur CSGO profile say silver 5 then
[3:41:33] <ThatLitDJ> you cant see my csgo profile thru twitch, idiot
[3:41:35] <+tronan_fex> with the new twitch beta, all our steams are linked to our twitch, so i can see ur prof, you dont have to lie to kick it @ThatLitDJ
[3:41:52] <+tronan_fex> LOLO!
[3:41:52] <ThatLitDJ> my steam isnt linked to twitch
[3:42:11] <+tronan_fex> yes it is, automatically, you obviously havent tried the beta
[3:42:27] <+tronan_fex> your waaaaaay behind the times Mr. Silver 5 :)
[3:42:57] <ThatLitDJ> it probably defaults to silver if its not linked, youre a moron
[3:43:01] <+KennnyMcCormick> You have no idea what you're talking about but you're so confident about your "all knowing" self it's funny to watch. ohnLUL
[3:43:14] <+tronan_fex> idk why you cant read either, i never said i was better than g2 at awp, i said heni is better than G2, but you obv didnt understand english typing xD
[3:43:22] <ThatLitDJ> give me ur steam ill add you, join my lobby
[3:43:45] <ThatLitDJ> you can see my rank then, too bad we cant play cuz you're like 12 ranks lower than me
[3:45:25] <ThatLitDJ> here i connected my steam
[3:45:43] <+KennnyMcCormick> You don't have to prove anything to anyone, just let it go man.
[3:45:53] <ThatLitDJ> check it out now, idiot. next time before you talk maybe have a clue wtf you're talking about

[1 day, 5:06:01] <+bootydragon> yeah
[1 day, 5:06:48] <+bootydragon> my mom was at subway yesterday, some guy walked in and asked the chick taking the orders "how big is a foot long"
[1 day, 5:10:11] <Boeufdecombat> 30 cm
[1 day, 5:10:23] <Boeufdecombat> everybody uses the metric system man
[1 day, 5:20:26] <+nebluh> 50 feet long
[1 day, 5:23:19] <+GoTTi1337> buying headarmor NotLikeThis
[1 day, 5:23:46] <chronicmp3> Why not buy head armour
[1 day, 5:24:06] <+GoTTi1337> everybody has AK/AWP, head armor won't protect you from a 1 shot
[1 day, 5:25:07] <+sacha_lawliet> still good to not get shot by a glock :p
[1 day, 5:25:20] <+sacha_lawliet> one-shot*
[1 day, 5:25:36] <chronicmp3> Yeah well what if they win the round with 5 alive
[1 day, 5:25:42] <+GoTTi1337> not worth 350$, rather get a flash or two to help your team
[1 day, 5:25:56] <chronicmp3> And they all took damage, then they have to pay 1k for head armour when they are on an eco
[1 day, 5:26:06] <chronicmp3> The enemy team that is
[1 day, 5:27:01] <+GoTTi1337> round was too important to think about what comes after, go all in, no head armor, 2 flashes
[1 day, 5:27:34] <chronicmp3> Or just you know buy head armour
[1 day, 5:27:46] <+GoTTi1337> Also G2s money was so good that there wouldn't have been an eco
[1 day, 5:28:06] <chronicmp3> You dont wanna die by a p250 the round after cause you were too greedy to procure a helmetr
[1 day, 5:28:21] <chronicmp3> G2s money wasnt that good
[1 day, 5:28:38] <+GoTTi1337> they lost the round and bought, so you are wrong :D
[1 day, 5:29:06] <chronicmp3> Bought pistols yea, your always gonna have enough for that unless you happen to by chance die after time as T
[1 day, 5:29:57] <+CharlieMKE> why would they waste that awp buy...
[1 day, 5:30:33] <chronicmp3> Cause they count on the fact that he will survive, and then have an awp for next round and not just drop an ak for an awp
[1 day, 5:30:43] <chronicmp3> Kind of like the greed of wether or not buying a helmet or not
[1 day, 5:30:49] <+CharlieMKE> nononono
[1 day, 5:31:19] <+CharlieMKE> ok so he bought an awp and his team bought pistols why would they waste the awp
[1 day, 5:31:58] <chronicmp3> Yeah you will always have 1400+ each round atleast
[1 day, 5:32:20] <chronicmp3> They didnt fully force up, Kennys only bought a p250 to get enough for the awp
[1 day, 5:32:58] <+CharlieMKE> you dont understand what im saying
[1 day, 5:33:36] <chronicmp3> oh dude i was respond to gotti twice wtf am i doing
