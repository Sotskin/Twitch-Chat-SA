[1 day, 11:38:01] <trollkarlen> nah
[1 day, 11:38:06] <wildpants35> MrDestructoid hi
[1 day, 11:38:09] <funnyluki1> SK!
[1 day, 11:38:26] <trollkarlen> I don't know why I am rewatching this I was watching in the Arena lol
[1 day, 11:38:42] <+Stampy75> i thought maybe it was viewbot
[1 day, 11:39:05] <funnyluki1> G2!
[1 day, 11:39:06] <+Stampy75> didn't think anyone would actually be watching reruns
[1 day, 11:39:30] <me_marque_se_o_fer_rushar> @trollkarlen remembering is living
[1 day, 11:39:33] <EdibleBug> so who won?! huh?!
[1 day, 11:39:38] <trollkarlen> I have nothing to do while we all are waiting for the major lol
[1 day, 11:39:56] <SliXys> im using this as background sound while i play LUL :D
[1 day, 11:40:01] <+Stampy75> true lol
[1 day, 11:40:21] <trollkarlen> But I feel like the Boston major is not gonna be as cool as the older ones with all the roster changes and stuff
[1 day, 11:40:36] <iskuzone> True that
[1 day, 11:41:15] <me_marque_se_o_fer_rushar> of course it'll be!! New teams, new roosters, new tatics
[1 day, 11:41:39] <me_marque_se_o_fer_rushar> tactics*
[1 day, 11:42:28] <trollkarlen> Yeah, that's also true I guess. But SK for example does not have boltz anymore due to dumb stand in rules and Astralis misses device aswell for instance
[1 day, 11:44:58] <wewhpt123> roosters hahah i laughed so hard on that one @me_marque_se_o_fer_rushar
[1 day, 11:45:02] <EdibleBug> everybody cheats!
[1 day, 11:45:28] <funnyluki1> NOOO

[1 day, 11:53:30] <me_marque_se_o_fer_rushar> @wewhpt123 CS roosters Jebaited
[1 day, 11:53:59] <jankeuter> Roasters
[1 day, 11:56:09] <Feagleyy> only 300 humans watching sk vs g2 lol
[1 day, 11:57:13] <me_marque_se_o_fer_rushar> always good to re-watch pro games, so much to learn, so much details
[1 day, 11:57:43] <tonikbeast> your ranks guys?
[1 day, 11:57:49] <trollkarlen> Supreme
[1 day, 11:57:50] <CristoSanchez> silver 2

[1 day, 11:58:01] <tonikbeast> i am DMG
[1 day, 11:58:09] <trollkarlen> I like to watch reruns sometimes to come up with tactics for my team
[1 day, 11:58:26] <tonikbeast> ye its good for those reasons
[1 day, 11:58:57] <trollkarlen> But it's hard see what everyone is doing on gun rounds since everyone has utility
[1 day, 11:59:02] <CristoSanchez> not the best actually
[1 day, 11:59:11] <CristoSanchez> best is ingame replays
[1 day, 11:59:18] <trollkarlen> yeah
[1 day, 11:59:50] <trollkarlen> But it's more fun to watch with commentators since they sometimes try to tell the viewers what's going on and why
[1 day, 12:00:16] <trollkarlen> Not that I don't realise that myself but you kinda get my idea
[1 day, 12:01:18] <KiNGs_mit1Cpt> SK threw so hard this game lol
[1 day, 12:01:34] <Sask3li96> yeah the commentators really help players who are new to cs
[1 day, 12:01:45] <CristoSanchez> is this the banana push of doom game?
[1 day, 12:01:55] <KiNGs_mit1Cpt> yes
[1 day, 12:02:01] <CristoSanchez> now I remember NotLikeThis
