[9:51:02] <ADAMSINDR0GBA> when i play smg %99 mp5 %1 others for sure
[9:51:06] <SweetieCandyLove> it wasnt named autolame by mistake
[9:51:07] <Thebelgianbg> it's how people name this gun
[9:51:09] <iammatt666> i remember the first map i played was playground_x and the first gun i used was the mp5 BibleThump memories
[9:51:17] <ascesso> @Thebelgianbg I never understood if its the ppl using or the ones getting killed by those weapons that's disgusting
