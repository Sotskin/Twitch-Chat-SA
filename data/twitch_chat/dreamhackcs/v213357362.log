[20:13:52] <zshgmng> go
[20:13:55] <gabrielj_w> the one on PC
[20:14:17] <FakeTheRow> i dont have it on my pc
[20:14:35] <gabrielj_w> it's on sale but I'd recommend literally any other video game over it
[20:14:57] <FakeTheRow> im jk i have it xd and 5 k hours packed with it
[20:15:24] <gabrielj_w> I was 100% serious when I said I'd recommend any other video game over it
[20:15:40] <FakeTheRow> how many hours do you have?
[20:15:47] <+g1__> why are we watching this
[20:16:03] <FakeTheRow> to learn something new and enjoy the action
[20:16:27] <FakeTheRow> lol you dont know anything then xd to suggest xd

[20:16:46] <FakeTheRow> lol duud g2a is epic
[20:17:09] <FakeTheRow> nope
[20:18:00] <FakeTheRow> .... your focusing on things that really doesnt matter
[20:18:15] <FakeTheRow> watch and leaen newbie
[20:18:28] <zshgmng> if u have sponsors u must advertise their names :)
[20:18:57] <FakeTheRow> honestly gabrielj i can explain in to you but i cant understand it for you xd
[20:20:44] <gabrielj_w> wat
[20:21:10] <gabrielj_w> I seem to have triggered some censorship script by joking about CS:S being bad?
[20:21:22] <zshgmng> who cares the names? :D watch to learn or jost for fun:D
[20:21:28] <horacee> uuuuhhhh
[20:21:34] <horacee> Youre never gonna understand
[20:22:01] <FakeTheRow> +
[20:22:16] <gabrielj_w> I watch pro CS for the cool moments. I don't think you can really learn much from it, honestly, unless you've got a dedicated team you're playing with.
[20:22:32] <gabrielj_w> The big difference between this and pub games is the coordination, not the ability to aim or map sense.
[20:22:45] <FakeTheRow> idk why you even talk with 500 hours xd
[20:22:57] <gabrielj_w> I was kidding about the 0.5 hours.
