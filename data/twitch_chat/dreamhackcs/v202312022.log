[7:44:09] <GreekDudesRPG> it is easy even a silver can spray like this
[7:44:27] <+oDavus> do they manualy spam there mouse or do they automaticaly hold it down?
[7:44:31] <GreekDudesRPG> the most important is headshots
[7:44:54] <mahmmuod55> in AK 47 in on line ?
[7:45:06] <GreekDudesRPG> i dont know every pro have his own way to spray
[7:45:09] <+oDavus> yes

[7:47:24] <GreekDudesRPG> when i spray i just hold my mouse and the same time croutch
[7:48:44] <+oDavus> whats your crouch keybinded too?
[7:48:50] <GreekDudesRPG> But when i use ak-47 i spray like and the same time hold and move it 1cm right and 1 cm left while i control it
[7:49:11] <GreekDudesRPG> totally success
[7:49:41] <GreekDudesRPG> i dont know if i made my self understood
