[14:40:01] <Nomad__xD> You said you at the event where is it?
[14:40:04] <AGDQ_raid> LISTEN TO ME, i have never had a grillfriend, im out of my fucking mind
[14:40:21] <AGDQ_raid> i know what i am doing
[14:40:32] <Nomad__xD> @agdq_raid where is this event being broadcasted from?
[14:40:47] <Nomad__xD> You said your at it
[14:41:02] <AGDQ_raid> @NomadonPC be more specific
[14:41:33] <AGDQ_raid> @NomadonPC yeah im sitting next to the server that is streaming this stream, makes sense
[14:41:34] <Nomad__xD> Same question just more simple for you
[14:42:08] <Nomad__xD> Country, town, stadium
[14:42:57] <Nomad__xD> Yeah didn‚Äôt think so
[14:43:04] <AGDQ_raid> NA, no, no
[14:43:21] <AGDQ_raid> im not getting doxed
[14:43:45] <AGDQ_raid> further questions?
[14:44:22] <Nomad__xD> This event was being held and broadcasted from Sweden, Malmo and I don‚Äôt know what stadium
[14:44:41] <Nomad__xD> Your iq is so low for you NA scrubs
[14:44:46] <AGDQ_raid> ok, so why the fuck are you asking me?
[14:45:12] <AGDQ_raid> you ask me a question that you dont even know the answers to and then call me stupid
[14:45:14] <Nomad__xD> Because you said you where at this event which is in Sweden yet you say your in NA
[14:45:37] <AGDQ_raid> NA = Not Applicable
[14:45:46] <AGDQ_raid> you ask me a question that you dont even know the answers to and then call me stupid
[14:45:47] <Nomad__xD> Rerun stands for a rebroadcast of a previous event in a live form
[14:46:00] <AGDQ_raid> no, RERUN is a SPONSOR
[14:46:05] <Nomad__xD> I gave you the answer
[14:46:37] <AGDQ_raid> then state it to me again because it was not clear enough the first time
[14:47:11] <AGDQ_raid> go to the admins then
[14:47:48] <AGDQ_raid> if they even exist
[14:47:59] <AGDQ_raid> or sorry go to the MODS WutFace
[14:48:28] <AGDQ_raid> says what?
[14:48:57] <lncypau> nomadon fvcking idiot
[14:49:14] <AGDQ_raid> RERUN is in the TITLE
[14:49:21] <lncypau> agdq is trolling
[14:49:41] <AGDQ_raid> you would pay way more to be in the title of the stream vs being in the list of sponsors
[14:49:59] <@Moobot> DreamHack Store: http://store.dreamhack.com/?utm_source=twitch_CS&utm_campaign=twitch_panel&utm_medium=twitch
