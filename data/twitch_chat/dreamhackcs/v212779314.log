[2:45:27] <lil_mati> what this year?
[2:45:37] <+TootooSE> 2012
[2:45:38] <Akrosstv> LUL
[2:45:53] <lil_mati> flashback to 2012
[2:46:27] <dhdreamhello> cs 1.6 WHAT
[2:46:28] <+TootooSE> It does feel like 99 though LUL
[2:46:59] <d3vaster> great moments
[2:47:10] <d3vaster> amazing
[2:47:42] <dhdreamhello> not live
[2:49:23] <mittelmuus> what not live :O omg
[2:49:52] <lilpeepforever> ouuuu
[2:49:54] <patrysiek22> hehe xD i dream about it live
[2:50:03] <SZAJBUS1992> lets go navi
[2:50:07] <lilpeepforever> its classic
[2:50:38] <patrysiek22> it's the definition of real counter-strike, pure skill
[2:52:06] <+TootooSE> I was not really into CS back in 2012 and I find it pretty amazing that it looked "this bad". CS:GO made loads to make this game commercial I think
[2:52:32] <bgtip> thisd game came out in like 1999 or something
[2:52:38] <bgtip> even it was played in 2012
[2:53:05] <+TootooSE> That makes sense
[2:53:25] <+TootooSE> Explains why it looks like it does LUL
[2:53:40] <novalaki> its 1.6 dude
[2:53:54] <novalaki> this game was made in 1999
[2:57:24] <sweat_doctors> wtf is this lol
[2:57:35] <BuffDudeM> 1.6
[2:57:41] <BigDaddieTheo> good old cs 1.6
[2:58:48] <sweat_doctors> they really did this in 2012? lol
[2:59:24] <BuffDudeM> yup
[2:59:46] <novalaki> i have a lot of memories on css
[2:59:51] <sweat_doctors> when did they use Source ?
[2:59:57] <novalaki> i didnt play 1.6 that much i didnt like it
[3:00:02] <+jiveturkey34> 2004 -2012
[3:00:22] <sweat_doctors> Source not 1.6
[3:00:41] <sweat_doctors> what year
[3:00:44] <+jiveturkey34> source was 2004-2012 1.6 was 1999 - 2012
[3:00:56] <syntt> 1.6 was always more popular than source
[3:00:58] <sweat_doctors> oh ok so they did both lol dam
[3:01:13] <novalaki> yeah thats true but i liked source way more
[3:01:25] <+TootooSE> Thank god for CS:GO release LUL
[3:01:40] <byZedd> CSGO ResidentSleeper
[3:01:46] <byZedd> 1.6 is the shit
[3:01:53] <sweat_doctors> right ^^
[3:02:03] <novalaki> csgo ruined it all
[3:02:16] <novalaki> after skins counter strike has never been the same
[3:02:22] <byZedd> ^
[3:02:30] <byZedd> Fuck valve's money milking shit.
[3:02:44] <novalaki> Fr i just wanna go back to the old days
[3:02:56] <byZedd> I used to play CSCO while it was still alive.
[3:03:04] <byZedd> Was a good community.
[3:03:13] <novalaki> yeah
[3:03:32] <byZedd> I still play 1.6 tho.
[3:03:46] <+TootooSE> CS:GO ded, LUL
[3:04:11] <novalaki> i remember when i got csco and played that for like 30 hours straight
[3:04:13] <+TootooSE> But I get it. I know a lot of people who loved this game back in the day. I just never got into it myself
[3:04:49] <novalaki> CSGO is dead. and im kinda happy about it. hopefully valve learns there lesson
[3:05:19] <apizza4you> How is CS:GO dead?
[3:05:19] <byZedd> CSGO isn't really dead, it is dying slowly though.
[3:05:28] <byZedd> CSCO is dead.
[3:05:32] <novalaki> yeah
[3:05:41] <novalaki> hopefully valve changes it up
[3:05:46] <apizza4you> How?
[3:05:49] <lauris_dose> they fucked cs go by adding trust factor for mm that shit is broken
[3:06:00] <SoZz> teufHey
[3:06:11] <novalaki> theres a lot of things wrong with cs
[3:06:14] <byZedd> No one plays MM anymore.
[3:06:17] <lauris_dose> yup
[3:06:21] <novalaki> im just gonna sit back and enjoy this game
[3:06:39] <apizza4you> I dont play mm. How does that make the game dead?
[3:06:44] <+TootooSE> It's a meme, that's it. numbers are still looking good, more investors get into esports and CS, events are attracting more and more audience...
[3:06:58] <novalaki> Summit1G is playing csgo right now im gonna go watch that
[3:07:10] <lauris_dose> but it was fun to play with my friends playing mm you know but no having to face a cheater each game is kinda sad
[3:07:17] <apizza4you> U say its dead but cant tall me y
