[3:58:03] <sixter_> xgod
[3:59:17] <CAPTAIN_ALPHARI_POGCHAMP> @sixter0 who won this match
[3:59:24] <+TheStampedeTMG> Gambit with Zeus was actually a really sick team
[3:59:28] <sixter_> dont know
[4:00:08] <+TheStampedeTMG> Zeus is a great IGL, mainly from all his 1.6 time with NA'VI
[4:00:24] <+TheStampedeTMG> Zeus and Sgares are my fav IGLs of all time
[4:00:38] <CAPTAIN_ALPHARI_POGCHAMP> no one but the danes are great
[4:00:38] <+MikeKoch> @CAPTAIN_ALPHARI_POGCHAMP I speak
[4:00:48] <CAPTAIN_ALPHARI_POGCHAMP> team north is the best
[4:00:48] <+MikeKoch> English sorry
[4:01:05] <+TheStampedeTMG> idk what it is but Magisk's face is so punchable lmao
[4:01:07] <CAPTAIN_ALPHARI_POGCHAMP> g2 and kennyS also ok ;)
[4:01:27] <CAPTAIN_ALPHARI_POGCHAMP> mAgisKboYYYYY is not on north
[4:01:41] <+MikeKoch> XGOD
[4:01:48] <+MikeKoch> DOSIA
[4:02:10] <CAPTAIN_ALPHARI_POGCHAMP> Why do you have a danish name then ,@MikeKoch
[4:02:32] <+MikeKoch> ich komme auf deutschland
[4:03:09] <+MikeKoch> aber ich spreche ein bisschen deutsche
[4:03:25] <+MikeKoch> U S A
[4:03:37] <+TheStampedeTMG> My favorite CSGO team was honestly the 2015 Fnatic with Pronax, that team was looking unstoppable
[4:03:49] <+TheStampedeTMG> Never understand why they make roster changes while they were winning majors
[4:03:50] <CAPTAIN_ALPHARI_POGCHAMP> hast du ein banane fur mein affe gekauft @MikeKoch
[4:04:33] <+MikeKoch> nein
[4:04:58] <CAPTAIN_ALPHARI_POGCHAMP> who was the best cs player ever? HeatoN? Kappa
[4:05:15] <CAPTAIN_ALPHARI_POGCHAMP> I think kennyS
[4:05:39] <+TheStampedeTMG> HeatoN is the best because he designed the EC from Zowie Kappa
[4:05:45] <+MikeKoch> TaZ without a dought
[4:05:52] <+MikeKoch> doubty* wow
[4:05:55] <+TheStampedeTMG> for real though best mouse shape I've ever used, probably the best shape possible for the most people
[4:06:15] <+MikeKoch> its someone on fckin VP for sure
[4:06:58] <+TheStampedeTMG> I think Neo for 1.6 and consistency -wise probably Cold for CSGO
[4:07:24] <+MikeKoch> Cold is a beast
[4:08:22] <+MikeKoch> he hurt his wrist
[4:09:10] <+MikeKoch> scream was one of the best shots in the game then the shooting update happened where being a one tap god was easier than ever
[4:09:46] <+MikeKoch> not that scream got worse its that the game just got easier for everyone
[4:10:01] <+MikeKoch> he is terrible on LAN
[4:10:17] <+MikeKoch> i think the only good LAN he's had was the BO7 vs SK
[4:10:30] <+MikeKoch> he went off there but usually always trailing at bottom @ LANS
[4:11:26] <+MikeKoch> sad to see NV playing in Minors
[4:12:04] <jepander88> NV is dead tbh :P
[4:12:31] <+TheStampedeTMG> NV was amazing with KennyS and Kio
[4:12:39] <+MikeKoch> tbh Sixer is the problem with NV rn
[4:12:53] <jepander88> nv was good when they was ldlc Kappa
[4:12:56] <+MikeKoch> he's just as toxic as Simple but not half as good
[4:13:30] <+TheStampedeTMG> Simple's not that bad these days, probably because he can EASILY smurf in Global, he knows how good he is and doesn't need to be toxic anymore
[4:13:52] <+TheStampedeTMG> Dude carries global teams on the reg, he's on another level for real
[4:14:20] <jepander88> simple aint good :D
[4:14:29] <jepander88> just baiting kills tbh :P
[4:15:34] <Spiky10> why are people watching an old match? lol
[4:15:44] <jepander88> its live lol? :D
[4:15:51] <Spiky10> lol
[4:16:01] <+TheStampedeTMG> Because it's a good place to chill and talk CS
[4:16:06] <Spiky10> its a RERUN :p
[4:16:41] <jepander88> spiky y u watch old movies? :P
[4:16:51] <jepander88> what u have seen already
[4:17:22] <GriveMimii> who actually won?
[4:17:25] <+TheStampedeTMG> I don't even remember who took this one so it's not really old for me
[4:17:26] <GriveMimii> north?
[4:17:36] <jepander88> i think sk gaming won
[4:17:48] <GriveMimii> i mean this match
[4:18:10] <GriveMimii> ..
[4:18:16] <CAPTAIN_ALPHARI_POGCHAMP> probably north they are best
[4:18:32] <CAPTAIN_ALPHARI_POGCHAMP> north and astralis best teams
[4:18:47] <+TheStampedeTMG> I mean skill-wise North should but who knows Gambit's super dark-horse they win tons of matchups they probably shouldn't
[4:18:48] <jepander88> @GriveMimii look at hltv :) its great site, u can see all matches there ;)
[4:19:00] <+MikeKoch> north win semi, G2 win final
[4:19:10] <GriveMimii> when those matches were actually lives, how many viewers did this stream have?
[4:19:29] <jepander88> like 500k to 2million
[4:19:32] <+MikeKoch> 40k guess?
[4:19:35] <GriveMimii> WUT
[4:19:42] <GriveMimii> LUL

[4:19:58] <GriveMimii> did they stop streaming?
[4:20:05] <jepander88> Streams was like 400k + tv and other streams :P
[4:20:08] <GriveMimii> 500k Kappa
[4:20:25] <GriveMimii> but do they still stream?
