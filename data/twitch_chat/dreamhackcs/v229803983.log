[8:16:59] <jogusko> monkaX
[8:50:43] <skelettkonig> cloud 9 are the best
[8:50:50] <+00kanplan00> no
[8:51:02] <+forrestwilson> debatable
[8:51:09] <+00kanplan00> correct
[8:51:14] <FraggZ> yea
[8:51:20] <+forrestwilson> SK better overall IMO
[8:51:27] <+00kanplan00> no
[8:51:28] <+forrestwilson> C9 still good though
[8:51:29] <FraggZ> yup
[8:52:52] <+forrestwilson> stew gets fucked on
[8:53:15] <+SimTask_TV> I tried out for C9 twice. My preference to M4 over AK hurt me the second time.
[8:53:40] <+SimTask_TV> And no awp skills =/
[8:54:37] <+forrestwilson> rip
[8:56:02] <+SimTask_TV> Back in April or May in 2016. They picked up Rush though. He was clearly better all around player
[8:56:16] <+SimTask_TV> Just burns me that a LOL player got picked over me =)
[8:56:37] <+forrestwilson> well he was playing for optic so he's already at that high level
[8:56:44] <+forrestwilson> js
[8:56:50] <+SimTask_TV> Ya. I was a unknown
[8:57:08] <+SimTask_TV> I was tried because I was Cal series for 6 seasons with clan WHO in 1.6
[8:57:36] <+forrestwilson> ok
[8:57:53] <+SimTask_TV> They still use me in practice matches @ times. But in the last year with the roster change, that died off
[8:58:35] <FraggZ> Didn't they pick up Rush last year?
[8:59:09] <+SimTask_TV> Ya, in start of 2016. April or May
[8:59:14] <+SimTask_TV> Cant remember
[8:59:32] <FraggZ> last year was 2k17 m8
[8:59:42] <+forrestwilson> LUL
[8:59:46] <+SimTask_TV> lol
[8:59:54] <+SimTask_TV> It is 6am and I am high
[9:00:01] <MakePoppyGreatAgain> Wait it is rush from lol??
[9:00:04] <FraggZ> all good man
[9:00:07] <+SimTask_TV> Ya
[9:00:12] <+forrestwilson> nope rush from optic
[9:00:24] <+forrestwilson> but yeah there was a c9 rush LOL player in 2015
[9:00:38] <+SimTask_TV> no, LOL, League of Legends
[9:00:40] <MakePoppyGreatAgain> Ah i know rush from lol hes a funny guy
[9:00:46] <+SimTask_TV> He was B team in 2015
[9:01:02] <MakePoppyGreatAgain> Ah
[9:01:43] <+SimTask_TV> He was a used B team.. He was very good but they did not move him to A because of his activities in LOL
[9:02:24] <+SimTask_TV> I believe they called it Main team and Challenger team
[9:03:49] <+SimTask_TV> He left the team though to go back to Korea I believe
[9:08:39] <+SimTask_TV> I would like to see some games with n0thing. He was a friend in 1.6. Played for Evil Geniuses. He was epic

[1 day, 13:33:02] <+MrStruts> if people getting put off by an AWP nerf, then you probably need to improve your gameplay
[1 day, 13:33:51] <xxxk1llsenxxx> I play differently now
[1 day, 13:34:06] <xxxk1llsenxxx> I became more on the defense
[1 day, 13:34:11] <xxxk1llsenxxx> Which is actually harder
[1 day, 13:34:15] <xxxk1llsenxxx> So I
[1 day, 13:34:35] <xxxk1llsenxxx> Practice my reflex everyday just so that I can become more aggressive

[1 day, 13:42:34] <+MrStruts> Huh, guess at least there's hope for me if I wanna go competitive
[1 day, 13:42:44] <xxxk1llsenxxx> XD not anymore
[1 day, 13:42:50] <xxxk1llsenxxx> The best time was when the game started
[1 day, 13:43:13] <+MrStruts> it's not like this one's gonna die anytime soon
[1 day, 13:43:16] <xxxk1llsenxxx> But when I got my rank everyone was dogshit which explains why I got a good rank
[1 day, 13:43:27] <Spy_Man69> I still suck at this game
[1 day, 13:43:37] <xxxk1llsenxxx> Yeah me too :D
[1 day, 13:43:39] <Spy_Man69> but they call me waller
[1 day, 13:43:49] <+MrStruts> and I couldn't care less about casual rank, anyone can solo that shit
[1 day, 13:43:53] <xxxk1llsenxxx> I have never been called a Waller
[1 day, 13:44:01] <xxxk1llsenxxx> But reported more than a hundred times
[1 day, 13:44:03] <+MrStruts> I wanna work with a good team
