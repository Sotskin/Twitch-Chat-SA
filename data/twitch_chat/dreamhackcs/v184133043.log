[0:17:06] <drobotnic> best of 1?
[0:17:09] <+Deletedtaters> The event was earlier today
[0:17:09] <+ops_drops50> this happened earlier. i watched it earlier
[0:17:22] <Grant482> it says live
[0:17:35] <Grant482> the channel is live streaming it
[0:17:44] <+ops_drops50> its a rerun
[0:17:52] <+ccheney15> this happened yesterday, finals are tmrw. this was a bo1
[0:17:52] <+ops_drops50> us*
[0:17:56] <xXxPusseeSlayerxXx> technically its a live rerun haha
[0:18:05] <Grant482> isnt rerun the drink that sponsors them?
[0:18:14] <+ops_drops50> no
[0:18:19] <+ccheney15> ok ok yeah anything you are watching on twitch is live kiddo
[0:19:13] <+ops_drops50> what do you mean by a bunch of shit as a silver @T__A__N__N__E__R
[0:19:25] <+ops_drops50> trash mb
[0:19:29] <+monogmon> THE ASIAN CONNECTION
[0:20:35] <+ops_drops50> what about campers?
[0:20:42] <+ops_drops50> is it bad like cod
[0:21:30] <+ops_drops50> camper sits in one spot for a long period of time
[0:21:47] <xXxPusseeSlayerxXx> @entity_drops usually ct's "camp" since its their job to defend the bombsites
[0:22:21] <+ops_drops50> well thats understandable but others that shouldnt camp do they....
[0:22:44] <+ops_drops50> i dont want to spend money on this and end up raging quiting every time
[0:22:57] <xXxPusseeSlayerxXx> in some specific situations , yes
[0:23:24] <T__A__N__N__E__R> camping is part of cs man, nobody gets mad or calls people a camper" per say.
[0:23:25] <+ops_drops50> but its not like every person campin and no team work?
[0:23:41] <xXxPusseeSlayerxXx> but the maps are so small that in the first 20 games you will know where the players may be camping
[0:23:43] <T__A__N__N__E__R> you watch high traffic areas or entrances
[0:24:13] <monamiQ> anasının amı derler adama
[0:24:17] <xXxPusseeSlayerxXx> in low ranks is common to be every man for himself
[0:24:33] <T__A__N__N__E__R> csgo is awesome, if you never have played, id recommend it. its a good time. so much to it
[0:24:49] <+ops_drops50> i want it
[0:25:09] <T__A__N__N__E__R> pretty big learning curve, but its fun
[0:25:10] <+PoopSak_> this dude
[0:25:16] <+ops_drops50> but i have a 5 month son so money is kinda tight
[0:25:56] <xXxPusseeSlayerxXx> luckily it isnt the most expensive of games
[0:26:09] <+ops_drops50> its not $60
[0:26:21] <xXxPusseeSlayerxXx> more like 15
[0:26:32] <+ops_drops50> well shit ok
[0:26:45] <+ops_drops50> thanks man

[0:34:51] <+ops_drops50> i knew crockpot but thats it
[0:35:32] <GreatEagleT> Vac
[0:35:52] <drobotnic> vac
[0:36:46] <+ops_drops50> so this is basically and more tactical snd
[0:37:26] <lowblip> basically yeah
[0:37:44] <+ops_drops50> ight
[0:37:44] <SlothManProfficcy> eating wheat thins and watching a good match. lovin the new c9 FeelsGoodMan
[0:38:07] <Teibazitch> "he knew it" ... ez vac
[0:38:10] <lowblip> c9 will never be the same without shroud
[0:38:13] <+ops_drops50> now i want some wheat thins... damnit
[0:38:31] <SlothManProfficcy> ehh shroud was good but he could choke a lot
[0:38:39] <jaumzeiras1406> algum br ai?
[0:38:42] <PleasantPhantom9> Shroud was more interested in streaming than csgo, probably got burnt out after so many years being #1 NA
[0:38:57] <SlothManProfficcy> ^
[0:39:06] <UnderageBestage> That background noise is kind of annoying
[0:39:25] <+ops_drops50> what background noise
[0:39:29] <lowblip> I think it's for the best that Shroud left. It's better to have more dedicated players
[0:39:37] <UnderageBestage> The other anouncers in the stadium
[0:39:51] <UnderageBestage> You can hear I through the commentators mics
[0:40:15] <+h0vercat> cloudnoun
[0:40:27] <+ops_drops50> i dont know shroud but it also is good to have good teammates.. if someone is not giving their all then drop him and pick up someone who will
[0:40:42] <+ops_drops50> now i dont know if that was the case but still
[0:41:06] <+ops_drops50> i hear it now @UnderageBestage
[0:41:17] <demonixx514> shroud is a god
[0:41:25] <ZYisHere> shroud was previously c9 right
[0:41:25] <@Moobot> DreamHack Store: http://store.dreamhack.com/?utm_source=twitch_CS&utm_campaign=twitch_panel&utm_medium=twitch
[0:41:31] <demonixx514> yes
[0:41:33] <lowblip> yeah
[0:41:36] <demonixx514> now he's a c9 streamer
[0:41:40] <Abstrekt> ska LUL
[0:41:41] <lowblip> Well he technically still is c9
[0:41:42] <ZYisHere> why did he left thou ?
[0:41:52] <lowblip> He wanted to leave
[0:41:58] <lowblip> Full time stream
[0:42:02] <demonixx514> he got burnt out, wasn't having fun anymore, makes more money full time streaming
[0:42:30] <UnderageBestage> Tarik drinking beer I think
[0:42:36] <PleasantPhantom9> Shroud is still better than 90% of pro players. Any team would pick him up if he wanted to go back
[0:42:49] <demonixx514> yeah
[0:43:28] <UnderageBestage> Shroud sucks
[0:43:31] <WasoyGaming> Is this live?
[0:43:36] <UnderageBestage> Yes
[0:43:38] <+ops_drops50> would c9 put him back on the team first or atleast offer him a position before he got more offers from other teams or what
[0:43:51] <+ops_drops50> i watched it earlier
[0:44:28] <demonixx514> shroud is actually still a fill in for c9 as well. if one of them can't play he can come in and play
[0:44:43] <+ops_drops50> ahh gotcha
[0:44:44] <ZYisHere> he is earning tons of bucks now full time streaming thou
[0:44:51] <demonixx514> yeah he is
[0:44:51] <ZYisHere> he has like more than 30k subs
[0:44:52] <Rooooooster> what noice
[0:44:53] <irwit2k> ai but he plays in third person
[0:45:07] <brandonnwi> did c9 win?
[0:45:11] <PleasantPhantom9> Guys is earning $100k+ a month easy. I wouldn't go back to pro csgo
[0:45:24] <demonixx514> neither would I lmao
[0:45:27] <+ops_drops50> no spiolers
[0:48:04] <irwit2k> shroud 9

[7:01:25] <gonzocc> rickeh is such a fucking waller even on renegades he was already hacking
[7:01:27] <denispow> lol
[7:01:43] <gonzocc> obviously can't go anywhere with that team, but still has cheats
[7:03:02] <Mrkruvi> do you legit think he is cheating or are you just kidding?
[7:03:17] <LorteSpasser> he is?
[7:03:28] <LorteSpasser> he even got caught in 1.6
[7:03:30] <mrMajestiic> who?
[7:03:39] <y0Blackeagle> then oskar is also cheating lmao
[7:03:47] <LorteSpasser> maby
[7:03:54] <LorteSpasser> probably
[7:03:58] <Mrkruvi> oskar is just bae
[7:04:13] <gonzocc> there's a massive cheater problem that valve wont acknowledge due to potential revenue disasters
[7:04:17] <y0Blackeagle> oskarJ?
[7:04:23] <gonzocc> take what you will from that.
[7:05:06] <sputnik692> i believe you are totally wrong about that, valve will without doubt ban hackers
[7:05:39] <Mrkruvi> you have a good point gonzocc but I think there is max 2 pros who are cheating
[7:05:58] <Mrkruvi> but that is just my opinion
[7:06:49] <sputnik692> lol "massive cheater problem"
[7:07:03] <slimfinger> !schedule
[7:07:03] <@Moobot> @slimfinger https://open.dreamhack.com/2017/denver-groups-schedule/
[7:07:21] <sputnik692> the chances of cheats in for example majors are super low
[7:07:30] <sputnik692> that is being checked for
[7:07:54] <mrMajestiic> Cheating as a pro player is like impossible
[7:07:56] <LorteSpasser> @sputnik692 lol
[7:08:03] <gonzocc> impossible?
[7:08:08] <gonzocc> you mean cheating on lan, i assume
[7:08:12] <Mrkruvi> not impossible
[7:08:14] <gonzocc> and far from it if you knew anything about technology
[7:08:36] <gonzocc> as long as it's online valve won't give them a pass
[7:08:42] <violentreflex> tell that to flusha
[7:08:46] <Mrkruvi> some players have cheats in his mouse :D
[7:08:47] <gonzocc> but offline events would prove to be too disastrous for valve to go ahead and ban players
[7:08:57] <sputnik692> lol what mm rank are u guys, still thinking flusha cheats
[7:09:07] <mrMajestiic> People believing flusha hacks in 2017 lul
[7:09:09] <gonzocc> valve would rather keep quiet than ruin a whole event due to cheaters, which is what would happen
[7:09:09] <sputnik692> <silver 5
[7:09:15] <gonzocc> im supreme
[7:09:30] <Mrkruvi> you know mm rank doesnt mean anything right?
[7:09:31] <gonzocc> brushing off accusations with player ranks is like
[7:09:37] <gonzocc> baby levels of argumentation
[7:10:27] <Mrkruvi> dab
[7:11:03] <sputnik692> people thinking that flusha cheats just because he has looked at people through walls from time to time is silly
[7:11:16] <gonzocc> lol
[7:11:22] <gonzocc> who else would defend flusha
[7:11:30] <gonzocc> flusha is living proof that valve doesnt give a shit about banning pros
[7:11:38] <gonzocc> because they'd lose too much money from the scandal
[7:11:43] <sputnik692> how can you be so sure he is cheating?
[7:12:02] <gonzocc> theres like 20 different clips
[7:12:05] <Mrkruvi> no one can be sure
[7:12:09] <violentreflex> not saying he is cheating now but they do have clips
[7:12:09] <gonzocc> that he toggles in all of them
[7:12:09] <sputnik692> xd
[7:12:23] <gonzocc> no one can be sure but if statistically speaking you can bet on it, i would
[7:12:30] <gonzocc> he stopped cheating obviously
[7:12:42] <gonzocc> he couldn't possibly keep up the levels of ridiculousness with those clips
[7:12:46] <mrMajestiic> If that is your proof you can ban every player for that
[7:12:53] <gonzocc> and now flusha is a mediocre player by pro standards
[7:13:00] <gonzocc> possibly something to do with no longer having external assistance
[7:13:17] <gonzocc> @mrMajestiic most pros dont have 20+ clips of suspicious play
[7:13:20] <mrMajestiic> Maybe also different team and players?
[7:13:22] <gonzocc> maybe 2-3 in their whole career
[7:13:27] <gonzocc> within 1 year
[7:13:34] <sputnik692> not at all
[7:14:05] <gonzocc> honestly at this point knowing the massive cheating problem cs has, why would you assume the pro levels dont use even better cheats?
[7:14:19] <gonzocc> good faith isnt even an option at this point due to all the shady shit that has happened
[7:14:47] <ants2k> Can't really read the situation like that, just because the community does it, doesn't mean that the pros do it consistently
[7:14:47] <unpeguemuchomaspotente> xddd
[7:14:55] <iRevoluszyN> damn
[7:15:00] <gonzocc> you're assuming he is NOT cheating based on the same clips
[7:15:04] <domingosmc29> !schedule
[7:15:04] <@Moobot> @domingosmc29 https://open.dreamhack.com/2017/denver-groups-schedule/
[7:15:07] <gonzocc> when evidence, if anything, points towards the accusations
[7:15:18] <juanchoes> to many pros cheat
[7:15:19] <ants2k> Na, not talking about flusha, I mean overall.
[7:15:29] <germanberges> so you play with cheats, became professional, go to a pc that is not yours in a championship, and win without cheats.... SURE

[7:15:32] <Skteampsychopath> guys is c9 and mouz still in?
[7:15:33] <germanberges> stop telling shit
[7:15:34] <gonzocc> i never said "consistently"
[7:15:43] <germanberges> people hacks in cs:go like in every game
[7:15:43] <sputnik692> i feel like your that russian guy on the enemy team that always shouts "haxaxxaxaxax" in chat
[7:15:51] <sputnik692> 're*
[7:15:52] <+UnicornSalesman> @skteampsychopath yes
[7:15:55] <ants2k> Suspicious clips can happen accidentally lol, some players can hit immense gamesense
[7:15:57] <juanchoes> @mrMajestiic a lot
[7:15:57] <gonzocc> you could completely prevent pros from cheating if you didn't give them the liberties they currently enjoy
[7:16:03] <Skteampsychopath> and when in start is eu time
[7:16:08] <gonzocc> yeah
[7:16:12] <+scumpug> na nade
[7:16:14] <+UnicornSalesman> 18.00
[7:16:21] <+UnicornSalesman> Lol 18 00
[7:16:24] <Skteampsychopath> ok
[7:16:25] <gonzocc> obviously when flusha looked at en entire team through walls
[7:16:35] <sputnik692> ??
[7:16:42] <ants2k> Yeah, flusha was suspicious asf, that I agree with
[7:16:56] <gonzocc> so if you assume flusha cheats
[7:16:56] <juanchoes> i dont know how is flusha not banned
[7:17:14] <gonzocc> i dont want to believe this but at this point the chace of shox having cheated at one point or another is fucking huge
[7:17:30] <gonzocc> besides, you want more proof valve doesnt give a shit
[7:17:36] <gonzocc> p1mple got vac'd before
[7:17:38] <ants2k> Everyone who are too good are considered hackers lol
[7:17:43] <gonzocc> he's still an active player
[7:17:45] <ants2k> All we have are assumptions
[7:17:51] <gonzocc> do you see me accusing niko or coldzera?
[7:17:56] <ants2k> One vac doesnt define a player or his causes
[7:18:04] <hotblast> Maybe he was using the C9 lan trick to look at players through wall to get fans reaction
[7:18:10] <gonzocc> im accusing the players with an abundance of shady clips
[7:18:18] <+UnicornSalesman> simple's ban was an ESL Wire ban, no?
[7:18:32] <gonzocc> yeah because at this level you're not thinking about the game, you're thinking about how fans react
[7:18:39] <+cliper> The way he pronounces shz is sounding like poo in german :D
[7:19:01] <gonzocc> perhaps
[7:19:09] <gonzocc> ESL has its own anti cheat client
[7:19:18] <fribergak47> @gonzocc you talk too much stfu man
[7:19:20] <ants2k> I see, what you mean, but like @mrMajestiic said, the security measures are really strict
[7:19:23] <gonzocc> it's unlikely to give out false positives
[7:19:46] <ants2k> Online, anyone can turn it on, but on LAN it is close to impossible
[7:19:53] <gonzocc> how?
[7:19:59] <gonzocc> cheats nowadays are hardware bound
[7:20:17] <gonzocc> if a pro player was forbidden to access their pc's before events
[7:20:17] <ants2k> You believe those built-in mouse hacks?
[7:20:22] <gonzocc> it's not true
[7:20:28] <gonzocc> you *dont*?
[7:20:41] <gonzocc> mouse nowadays has software built into it it's not just drivers
[7:20:45] <MaikeloF> I know a guy that cheated at a esl lan
[7:20:47] <ants2k> It is possible, but it is too pseudo imo
[7:20:51] <gonzocc> taking that software and reverse engineering it is not hard for someone who knows what they're doing
[7:20:56] <MaikeloF> didnt get caught but was so obvious
[7:21:12] <gonzocc> part of why cs is dying
[7:21:18] <gonzocc> is due to the cheating scandals
[7:21:27] <gonzocc> i mean, cs *is* dying
[7:21:30] <MaikeloF> after he won the lan admitted he cheated and left the cs scene
[7:21:34] <gonzocc> 10k+ spectators on dreamhack?
[7:21:50] <+Stickypaper> cs wont die because of cheating in mm
[7:22:17] <Loth1c> MM is still a thing?
[7:22:34] <MaikeloF> MM is a joke
[7:22:45] <sneakyywoof> MM
[7:22:46] <+Stickypaper> multi million dollar majors and climbing, cs wont die
[7:22:55] <+UnicornSalesman> I played non prime mm today. 4Head
[7:23:09] <+Stickypaper> ouch
[7:23:17] <+Stickypaper> ^ :D
[7:23:24] <+UnicornSalesman> :D
[7:23:28] <Loth1c> maybe it will die because of the remake?
[7:23:41] <+Stickypaper> remake?
[7:23:45] <MaikeloF> They better bring in source 2 this year like they said they would in the start of 2k17
[7:24:03] <+Stickypaper> they wont remake go? if anything theyll just release a newer game in the future
[7:24:07] <sputnik692> how could the remake kill cs? it hasnt even been in the map pool
[7:24:19] <+UnicornSalesman> I'm not entirely sure source2 will change all that much
[7:24:50] <+Stickypaper> yeah it will be lower fps for low end pcs
[7:25:05] <Loth1c> data doesnt have a weight, so it can't be heavier
[7:25:07] <MaikeloF> But you are able to use more cores for your game then
[7:25:17] <+Stickypaper> but hey why not give a new panorama ui to boost fps lel
[7:25:43] <MaikeloF> lol
