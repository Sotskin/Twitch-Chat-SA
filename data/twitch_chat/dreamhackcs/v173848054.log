[0:47:59] <Miblik> Haven't seen that in a pro game in a while
[0:48:00] <+Justanormie> so they forfeited
[0:48:07] <scarface1g> is this the 3rd place match?
[0:48:27] <alesundl> yea
[0:48:43] <scarface1g> lol liar
[0:48:44] <KKoceanMan> is it live?
[0:48:59] <scarface1g> no
[0:49:07] <Miblik> it says rerun
[0:49:17] <scarface1g> this is the first match of group B, just realized it when i checked hltv
[0:49:32] <+spacebooterfly> stew is good
[0:49:35] <+Deadwaa> let him plant was such a mistake omg
[0:50:18] <scarface1g> it must pay alot to go out of groups of so many tournaments, otherwise how does complexity make any money? all the teams they have suck lol
[0:51:04] <ogsus1337> @scarface1g they have sponsors
[0:51:07] <scarface1g> they must tell the sponsors they have that they have top teams or something lmao
[0:51:19] <bgcDashie> make money through sponsors
[0:51:39] <ogsus1337> its just getting their logo on streams when players stream or wear jerseys
[0:52:04] <scarface1g> yeah but what im getting at is, what sponsor wants to sponsor a team that never wins
[0:52:25] <scarface1g> especially when a top sponsor must pay alot, especially if we take into account that coL has a gaming house and the players probably get salaried around
[0:52:25] <ogsus1337> a lot
[0:52:42] <scarface1g> i doubt the CS players make more then 3 or 5k a month
[0:52:53] <ogsus1337> most fortune 500 companies spend 10% of their rev. on marketing which includes sponsorships and product placement\
[0:53:14] <+c_w_s> i agree - fortune 600 CEO
[0:53:25] <scarface1g> yeah...but no fortune 500 companys sponsor coL do they..
[0:53:36] <Pheelbert> when is final?
[0:53:42] <+Smoke_Weeb_Every_Day> sponsors dont have to pay as much for teams that lose more
[0:53:44] <+c_w_s> 5 mins
[0:53:58] <Pheelbert> thx <3
[0:54:25] <+Smoke_Weeb_Every_Day> winning teams have more time on cam so they show the company logos more etc

[18:11:02] <+vertsabre> Shroud hit 30k subs btw
[18:11:17] <+vertsabre> I guess it was a good decision
[18:11:17] <GreekDudesRPG> he is streaming pubg now
[18:11:43] <+vertsabre> yeah, I don't watch PUBG, it sucks
[18:11:54] <GreekDudesRPG> well there s no point to quit after you are a pro player
[18:12:53] <matthero1313> He makes more than the entire C9 team right now. You do know that right
[18:13:12] <+vertsabre> Quit while you are ahead? And also he just wanted to so there is that.
[18:13:45] <GreekDudesRPG> 30K viewers = how much.money?
[18:13:58] <GreekDudesRPG> much money?
[18:14:32] <+vertsabre> Viewers don't give money unless you run ads, which don't play for subs and don't play for Prime users.
[18:14:33] <@Moobot> DreamHack Store: http://store.dreamhack.com/?utm_source=twitch_CS&utm_campaign=twitch_panel&utm_medium=twitch
[18:14:42] <matthero1313> 30K subs is about 90K a month
[18:14:50] <+vertsabre> Most comes from donos and subs
[18:15:11] <+vertsabre> 30k subs is enough money for an entire year
[18:15:15] <GreekDudesRPG> well to be a pro player you have to love the game you play. He wasnt

[23:46:37] <milesg3> honestly imve been watching the market
[23:46:47] <JCMSAMA> just google compare benchmarks 1050ti 1060
[23:46:52] <milesg3> i think after vega nvidia will have a rebuttle
[23:47:06] <youtool13> i hear 1060s arent worth
[23:47:48] <milesg3> there are leaks already about nvidia like 12nm architecture or something
[23:48:00] <milesg3> basically going to shut down amd after vega
