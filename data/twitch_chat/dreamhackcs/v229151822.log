[6:05:42] <calnerxd> @RyleeVulich16 its from 2016 so its old cs and old d2
[6:06:02] <calnerxd> the one we remember from when cs was good
[6:07:07] <RyleeVulich16> ummm dude you realise this map was in 1.6 right?
[6:07:19] <calnerxd> yes I do
[6:07:21] <RyleeVulich16> and it was way different
[6:07:36] <calnerxd> yes but I liked it most when it was like this
[6:07:36] <RyleeVulich16> so this is not old dust 2 its cs:go dust 2
[6:07:45] <RyleeVulich16> yea same
[6:08:04] <RyleeVulich16> i miss old nuke
[6:08:28] <calnerxd> I miss old csgo
[6:08:33] <RyleeVulich16> same
[6:08:52] <RyleeVulich16> nearly every game you play you get a troll on you're team
[6:09:04] <RyleeVulich16> :/
[6:09:20] <RyleeVulich16> team work does not exist in cs:go anymore
[6:09:25] <RyleeVulich16> its just toxic as fuck
[6:09:37] <calnerxd> ye
[6:09:59] <RyleeVulich16> How do you think NiP will do with dennis?
[6:10:11] <RyleeVulich16> rip xist :/ im gonna miss him
[6:10:24] <RyleeVulich16> xizt*
[6:10:50] <calnerxd> very good, think its good that they change to dennis because he's a very good player and they need new line up
[6:11:33] <RyleeVulich16> personal i think hes going to help them huge in pistol rounds and just pure fire power
[6:11:47] <RyleeVulich16> so its a good change
[6:12:34] <RyleeVulich16> and Rez and Draken are a perfect fit for the team they have mad nip a lot better already
[6:12:41] <RyleeVulich16> made*
[6:12:48] <calnerxd> yea, miss friberg
[6:13:03] <RyleeVulich16> yea same but hes not the same anymore

[8:51:43] <WSTT1> xD

[8:53:58] <slow_xd> lol i stil play 1.6 every day LUL
[8:54:03] <K7_OG> been playing since 1.3, you guys don't understand the era you missed out on
[8:54:33] <K7_OG> if i would've adapted to GO instead of grinding out 1.6 til its last days, i woulda been up there in GO rn
[8:54:54] <SkarletPL> ^ I started playing when 1.4 came out
[8:55:00] <nikimaruu1> good for you sir
[8:55:01] <+Toasteh> I didn't have the pc or anything didn't start playing shooters until like teenage years

[8:55:42] <Hoangtho1997> i used to play over and over again with cs 1.6 in cs_mansion
[8:55:42] <whatstherisk_> is this the map mirage is inspired of?
[8:55:49] <RubenTwitch> Karrigan is a beast, completing masters degree while being pro. That work ethic is admirable Kreygasm
[8:55:51] <+Toasteh> THEY ARE PLAYING THAT ONE FUCKING SONG
[8:56:00] <Hoangtho1997> oh memory BibleThump
[8:56:00] <K7_OG> that map is mirage

[9:03:33] <@Moobot> DreamHack Store: http://store.dreamhack.com/?utm_source=twitch_CS&utm_campaign=twitch_panel&utm_medium=twitch
[9:03:38] <chrom3n> except the final results haha
[9:03:42] <+Toasteh> the last time VP won something decent with this roster FeelsBadMAn
[9:03:57] <RubenTwitch> ^ LUL
[9:04:05] <chrom3n> @Toasteh they won vs sk ?
[9:04:09] <Wariaaat> 4Head
[9:04:21] <chrom3n> i wan that pc
[9:04:31] <chrom3n> i can kill eeryone that interupts me while gaming
[9:04:38] <SkarletPL> ^ what about epicenter 2017 ? LUL
[9:04:38] <chrom3n> LUL
[9:04:43] <Wariaaat> thats the plan Kappa
[9:05:10] <+Toasteh> yeah in this one
[9:05:30] <RubenTwitch> SPOILERS
[9:05:36] <+Toasteh> it's the last time the roster actually won a large tourny
[9:05:37] <chrom3n> the adds......
[9:05:48] <chrom3n> PunOko
[9:05:52] <+Toasteh> and we'll never see that same roster win another FeelsBadMan
[9:06:28] <chrom3n> @Toasteh then you guys should keep this rtoaster in mind as legends and look forward to he new one :)
[9:06:46] <RubenTwitch> So when will the last member of VP retire as player? I bet on a year from now
[9:07:05] <chrom3n> propably yea
[9:07:24] <SkarletPL> IMO Taz should retire right now
[9:07:59] <RubenTwitch> Well I guess he really likes playing pro and is prepared to take losses just to play
[9:08:11] <+Toasteh> Snax is only 24
[9:08:39] <RubenTwitch> True, I was just being synical they should be able to still do some good shit
[9:08:59] <+Toasteh> damn they made SK play back to back Bo3s
[9:09:28] <+Toasteh> granted it was north
[9:09:40] <RubenTwitch> I'm still salty that happened at the major
[9:10:32] <RubenTwitch> They still lost a map to c9 yesterday as well tho
[9:11:04] <+Toasteh> production on this stream was actually pretty good
[9:11:20] <RubenTwitch> God I love machine
[9:11:31] <RubenTwitch> He's by far the best desk host in cs
[9:12:00] <+Toasteh> they lost to c9 at summit aswell
[9:12:06] <+Toasteh> with full roster
[9:12:40] <RubenTwitch> Yeah, sk seems to struggle vs c9 i guess
[9:13:04] <+Toasteh> tarik said he knew how to play against them
[9:13:12] <SkarletPL> TBH i'm still surprised by how good c9 are
[9:13:19] <RubenTwitch> same
[9:13:36] <RubenTwitch> @Toasteh ofc he says that lul
[9:14:13] <+Toasteh> he's proved it
[9:14:51] <+Toasteh> they scrim often behind official matches so they know how they play and they caught them at a point where Fer isn't really showing up as the second star
[9:16:00] <SkarletPL> I wonder if SK will hit slump like VP
[9:16:24] <+Toasteh> nah
[9:16:31] <+Toasteh> because SK doesn't care about doing roster changes
[9:18:32] <ISurvivedH1Z1> die
[9:20:59] <+Toasteh> toxic

[21:14:13] <Zyvoxzerfall> I know Kappa
[21:14:17] <t1b0> ye, and bcs there are only 70 viewers u can get upto 5 drops
[21:14:27] <t1b0> 100*
[21:14:45] <Smitty18722> nip will win go bet on the match guys'
[21:15:08] <t1b0> cant find it on bettingsite do you have a link?
[21:15:22] <t1b0> Kappa
[21:16:04] <TheM0nstrum> wait, can you get drops by just watching this stream if it is linked?
[21:16:29] <t1b0> yeah
[21:16:42] <t1b0> upto 5 this game
[21:16:50] <t1b0> all worth 5 dollar
[21:17:12] <TheM0nstrum> is it a higher drop rate as there are 99 of us or is it the same chance still?
[21:17:21] <sneakydropbear121> Jebaited
[21:17:24] <t1b0> i hope u are joking
[21:17:31] <TheM0nstrum> because there are 600k more people watching right
[21:17:52] <t1b0> oh bro it's bedtime i think
[21:18:02] <TheM0nstrum> haven't kept up with cs in like 6 months. Not up to date with cs
[21:18:21] <TheM0nstrum> there are 100 viewers on twitch for me
[21:18:31] <t1b0> why would they gave drops for a simple lan and a rerun stream
[21:19:16] <TheM0nstrum> Didnt realise it was a rerun, jesus christ
[21:19:25] <t1b0> xD
[21:19:33] <TheM0nstrum> kill me please :)
[21:20:01] <t1b0> if u want a drop you need to follow Eleague on twitch and if there are 300k+ viewers u probably make a chanc
[21:20:54] <TheM0nstrum> well then. Probably gonna sleep now :D Good suggestion before.
[21:21:04] <t1b0> hahaha xD
