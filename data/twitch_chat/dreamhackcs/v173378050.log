[0:29:07] <Firerock24> Fired?
[0:29:12] <javiier07122001> he don't play more competitive ;/
[0:29:18] <1337Cronos> PogChamp PogChamp
[0:29:20] <Firerock24> Why?
[0:29:24] <javiier07122001> he get out from the competitive
[0:29:29] <+Vertac> he is on the bench
[0:29:38] <javiier07122001> he say only that
[0:29:44] <Firerock24> Oh but he is in the c9 team
[0:29:45] <1337Cronos> benched, now streamer for c9
[0:29:50] <+bl0ss0m> ptr on lan LUL
[0:30:02] <javiier07122001> but don't play competitive idk why
[0:30:20] <Firerock24> He is dumb he got so talent and he is wasting it for streaming pubg
[0:30:27] <javiier07122001> i think he and stewie are the best of c9
[0:30:39] <+Great_Crusader> He is streaming full-time on Twitch now. . @Firerock24 It is what he wanted.
[0:30:56] <Firerock24> Thnx man
[0:31:22] <javiier07122001> shrould it's playing battlegrund xD
[0:31:23] <+Great_Crusader> @Firerock24 No he is not. He makes way more money Streaming. He was pro for awhile, he was just tired of it and wanted to move on
[0:31:32] <+ArcAngel_> He is earnig big big bucks now and it's less stressful so I wouldn't say it's a bad move lol
[0:31:55] <+Great_Crusader> over 24k subs right now @arcangeliv_
[0:32:14] <javiier07122001> he have 27k viewers
[0:36:07] <+ArcAngel_> Yeah he's living comfy now. Good on him, miss him in the cs scene tho @great_crusader
[0:36:19] <+ArcAngel_> Just hope csgo bounces back from this little dip
[0:36:35] <+ArcAngel_> PUBG is taking over, but it'll never be the better esport
[0:38:56] <Corre111> What's valve doing ?
[0:39:07] <Corre111> I mean they don't update csgo
[0:39:25] <+ArcAngel_> Exactly @corre111 they need to do something
[0:39:47] <+ArcAngel_> Patch the games problems and it'll get it's popularity back when PUBG slows down
[0:40:14] <Corre111> Maybe they are doing another cs
[0:40:52] <+ArcAngel_> It'll happen eventually but not for a long time I don't think
[0:41:02] <+ArcAngel_> I feel like they've made csgo a 10-15 year game
[0:41:16] <ezrang1> c9 win???
[0:41:35] <Second_Element> to be completely honest I think they have been adding updates including more thing you'll have to buy because they're either planning something big, or making another game.
[0:41:57] <Corre111> As shroud said
[0:42:02] <+ArcAngel_> I feel like a big patch is coming
[0:42:09] <Second_Element> same
[0:42:09] <Corre111> They are doing another game
[0:42:26] <Corre111> Hope so xD
[0:42:36] <+ArcAngel_> I dunno the comp scene is the best it's been so they can still improve
[0:42:48] <KngFive5> Why do they come back?
[0:42:52] <Second_Element> but that shouldnt stop them from keeping csgo at its state since its such a popular esport
[0:43:09] <Corre111> Esports are making csgo alive actually
[0:43:13] <+ArcAngel_> Yeah valve don't just throw games out
[0:43:15] <Second_Element> yea
[0:43:15] <ratskinzcs> dreakhack montreal?
[0:43:27] <Second_Element> ohh shiiii
[0:43:41] <+ArcAngel_> The comp scene is defo keeping it alive
[0:43:41] <@Moobot> The desk consist of @Stunna , @LiquidPimpZ & @HazedCS
[0:43:51] <+ArcAngel_> The game is too toxic atm for new players etc
[0:44:08] <Second_Element> yea but valve just doesnt care about the pros enought yknow?
[0:44:20] <Corre111> Rusky kids
[0:44:58] <Corre111> Let's see what happens whit valve

[1:59:19] <WorlandCarryers24> !vote North
[1:59:50] <WorlandCarryers24> 16 - 6 ?

[2:01:02] <alfonzoromero26> 16-14
[2:01:35] <+incept3d> 480p?
[2:01:47] <Auriocs> 144p
[2:02:26] <+baqan> wtf is this quality
[2:02:43] <KebashPoint> looks around 240p if you are feeling generous!
[2:02:53] <Deeimoss> So fucked xd
[2:03:12] <+baqan> ya this is dumb lol
[2:03:30] <+baqan> @DreamHackCS fix dis
[2:03:46] <LuchooGG> dale tuteeeee
[2:03:50] <+incept3d> streaming from a pentium 4
[2:04:00] <+incept3d> 2.4ghz
[2:04:01] <WorlandCarryers24> It says 720p but it feels like 480
[2:04:03] <KebashPoint> looks like it is on an old VHS tape
[2:04:24] <+baqan> whats fucked is the audio is normal lol
[2:04:24] <+incept3d> its an old 1.6 frag movie
[2:04:35] <LuchooGG> vameeeeeee
[2:04:50] <+baqan> MarkE using up all the bandwidth
[2:04:59] <Deeimoss> @KebashPoint Lol xD
[2:06:16] <andydbc> why its so bad quality ?
[2:06:23] <twilarg> galeeeee
[2:06:35] <andydbc> tell me its live
[2:06:38] <WorlandCarryers24> @dr_strang33 Cause not enough sponsors... and not enough ads
[2:06:38] <KebashPoint> If it was 480p you would at least be able to read the teams names, so must be no more than 360p!
[2:06:44] <twilarg> nope baha
[2:06:45] <KLG_AT_WORLDS_LUL> RERUN:

[2:07:41] <WorlandCarryers24> @KebashPoint 360 you can't read the "Round" but you can allmost here so it is 480p
[2:08:00] <WorlandCarryers24> The game earlyer with North vs Kinguin had 1080p
[2:08:52] <KebashPoint> Casters must of used up all the bandwidth torrenting movies!!

[6:47:53] <+stormedbypizza> great play
[6:47:55] <GlubGlub101> Holy
[6:48:08] <+stormedbypizza> however its still a lucky play.
[6:48:10] <kushflava> shame tarik does fuck all for the rest of this match lol
[6:48:10] <Qwips> 99999 iq play
[6:48:24] <kushflava> @stormedbypizza how was that luck lol
[6:48:34] <+stormedbypizza> They did not clear the site??
[6:48:57] <+affliction_who> But that's not luck, just a poor play by IMT
[6:49:00] <+stormedbypizza> That's a huge misplay on immortals side. 4v2 you don't clear a site youre planting ?
[6:49:05] <kushflava> they had 2 headshot, they baited them into thinking they killed them all. it was smart. notice how tarik didnt peek the entire time
[6:49:14] <+affliction_who> it was a good play by Tarik and shit play by IMT
[6:49:29] <+stormedbypizza> I never said it was a bad play
[6:49:29] <kushflava> imortals shoudlve cleared it, but it wasnt lucky lol. tarik played it smart and immortals didnt
[6:49:52] <+stormedbypizza> Lucky he was given that chance. Tarik played it perfectly.
[6:50:02] <+stormedbypizza> It won't happen again I'm sure.
[6:50:20] <+oldemodave> bo1?
[6:50:34] <+stormedbypizza> A win mainly based off of a mistake is not a true win. It's not like cloud 9 as a whole outplayed immortals and won the round
[6:50:45] <+affliction_who> ?????
[6:50:47] <kushflava> They baited immortals perfectly. U make it seem like they just randomly rushed b with 3 guys holding it, and it just "worked out"
[6:50:57] <+stormedbypizza> nono
[6:51:03] <+affliction_who> Wins are almost entirely decided by opponents mistakes lol
[6:51:23] <+stormedbypizza> It's a damn pistol round. Stacking sites is an incredibly common play.
[6:51:24] <+affliction_who> Not sure you've ever played this game, or any competitive shooter with that kind of analysis
[6:51:33] <+stormedbypizza> pistol save/halfbuy round*
[6:51:36] <+tick_dickle> immortals wins
[6:51:49] <kushflava> having 2 headshot at b, and 1 hiding back triple is not common dude. lol
[6:51:49] <+stormedbypizza> Regardless of anything you have to clear the damn site. It's pretty fkin simpe
[6:52:05] <+affliction_who> You're right, it's common to stack a site..... which is why IMT should have checked
[6:52:05] <+stormedbypizza> Stacking a site when you have a half buy is common
[6:52:43] <+affliction_who> Your whole "not a true win" argument is incorrect in literally any sport
[6:52:53] <kushflava> immortals should have checked it, they fucked up. But tarik didnt get lucky, they made a nice play and it worked how they drew it up. IMO
[6:52:54] <+stormedbypizza> It isn't!
[6:53:09] <+affliction_who> Was the Chiefs win over the Pats last night "not a true win"?
[6:53:15] <+Tealtv> shroud4Head shroudC9
[6:53:24] <kushflava> yeah stormed that logic is kinda flawed lol
[6:53:25] <+stormedbypizza> Look at the score
[6:53:34] <+stormedbypizza> They did not win the following round
[6:53:37] <+affliction_who> Was the warriors blowing a 3-1 lead not earned by the Cavs?
[6:53:58] <+affliction_who> so unless you win every single round it "isn't a win"
[6:54:13] <+affliction_who> I'm sorry, you're an idiot
[6:54:24] <+stormedbypizza> I'm looking at the broad score of the match. It was a single mistake on the immortals side, giving cloud 9 a chance to make a god play.
[6:55:14] <+stormedbypizza> A ONE time thing. That round, or the REASON why they won that round is almost completely irrelevant to the remainder of the match
[6:55:20] <+affliction_who> Obviously IMT crushed c9, but you as soon as you start trying to say "this is a win, but this one isn't", you lose credibility. As long as you're not cheating, a win is a win.
[6:55:21] <@Moobot> Follow DreamHack on twitter.com/dreamhackcsgo - facebook.com/DreamHackCSGO - instagram.com/dreamhack - snapchat.com/add/dreamhacklive
[6:55:24] <+stormedbypizza> That's my point
[6:55:36] <+stormedbypizza> Of course a win is a fkin win.
[6:55:44] <kushflava> Yeah anything you say is just void , after saying A win mainly based off of a mistake is not a true win. It's not like cloud 9 as a whole outplayed immortals and won the round
[6:55:53] <+stormedbypizza> My point was simply that cloud 9 didn't really deserve that win, and it proves my point as they lost every round after that
[6:55:54] <+rikiricon_> clown9
[6:56:23] <+stormedbypizza> Sure they got 1 round, fkin congrats.
[6:56:26] <kushflava> ur right, they didnt deserve it, but it doesnt mean it isnt a real " win " because imortals made a mistake lol
[6:56:42] <+stormedbypizza> It's an irrelevant win
[6:56:46] <+affliction_who> That's just such a bullshit way to evaluate any sort of competition
[6:56:55] <+stormedbypizza> youre an idiot
[6:56:58] <kushflava> ^
[6:57:26] <kushflava> stormed, you actually think they dont deserve credit on winning a round, or winning anything, because the other team fucked up slightly ?
[6:57:34] <PyroFlow> i guess we can all agree after that that stormed is the idiot here
[6:57:37] <kushflava> You are the idiot my friend
[6:57:42] <chuckthefuq> OMG COMEBACK
[6:57:46] <+affliction_who> So if a team loses the World Series 4-1, does their 1 win not count????? Simply because they didn't win the whole fuckin thing?

[6:57:57] <kushflava> ^
[6:58:00] <+affliction_who> I honestly can't believe someone this dense exists
[6:58:03] <+stormedbypizza> I never said it doesn't count, don't put words in my mouth
[6:58:15] <+stormedbypizza> I never said its void

[7:05:06] <+affliction_who> @glubglub101 I mean they've only played like 2 tourneys
[7:05:18] <+affliction_who> And they've practiced together for maybe 2 weeks
[7:05:29] <+ThaScientist> Watch as the famous twitch experts tell you what players suck on the teams playing
[7:05:34] <+affliction_who> As in, the whole team
[7:05:34] <Dieseldogg> rush isnt good, what happened to swag
[7:06:00] <+Caniban> hes on dazeds team
[7:06:02] <+ThaScientist> @RemuDiesel swag is still banned from too many orgs to consider him as c9
[7:06:12] <+affliction_who> Swag was subbing for auti
[7:06:27] <+affliction_who> Also the ban lol
[7:06:29] <Dieseldogg> dazed actually starting a team?
[7:06:49] <chuckthefuq> banned BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[7:06:49] <Dieseldogg> i thought they unbanned?
[7:06:58] <+affliction_who> Realistically, there's no way c9 would ever take a player who can't attend a major
[7:06:58] <MTROficial> ALGUEM AI PRA IR UM COMP ??
[7:06:58] <+Caniban> yeah dpr azk swag dazed Pollo
[7:07:01] <chuckthefuq> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[7:07:13] <+ThaScientist> @RemuDiesel only from dreamhack and something else, still not from ecs and majors
[7:07:18] <+affliction_who> They were unbanned from ESL and DH
[7:07:25] <Dieseldogg> damn that blows
[7:07:35] <+ThaScientist> @RemuDiesel so you would sign a player that is not allowed to come to any major ever, dont think c9 want that
[7:07:41] <Dieseldogg> better than nothing
[7:07:43] <GlubGlub101> I'm not saying Rush is bad but it's taking him a lot longer than Taric to get find his footing with the team
[7:08:08] <+affliction_who> TBH they should stay banned, if exports want to be taken seriously then you simply cannot accept match fixing
[7:08:16] <+ThaScientist> @GlubGlub101 do you know what he is supposed to do on the team? not everybody can be a main-fragger
[7:08:19] <+affliction_who> Every other sport perm bans for it
[7:08:37] <KritikaL17> I don't give a F about C9 now that Shroud isn't there
[7:09:19] <+jugoV> @GlubGlub101 On a team of 4 fraggers, there will always be one suffering in terms of rating. Give them time.
[7:09:24] <+didsomeresearch> this caster duo couldnt get any more terrible
[7:09:29] <+affliction_who> Shroud retiring was easily the smartest decision to make tho, I wouldn't even want him to return
[7:09:30] <@Moobot> http://open.dreamhack.se/news/436-astro-gaming-joins-as-title-sponsor-for-dreamhack-astro-open-2017.html
[7:09:59] <KritikaL17> Shroud was a legend. Never seen wnyone with a aim like him
[7:10:14] <KritikaL17> Coming from an Astralis fan
[7:10:16] <+ThaScientist> Ultimatively shroud could have continued playing and he would have done ok atleast but retiring now was maybe the best decision
[7:10:38] <+affliction_who> He wasn't THAT good lol.... he's def a top tier player tho. More support than anything
[7:11:06] <+itsjustmatt123> ska has been playing so good lately
[7:11:16] <kushflava> is that moron still here in chat, i want to be entertained some more
[7:11:19] <+affliction_who> I've competed at events for other games, it's simply too stressful to keep up unless you're passionate af about it
[7:11:21] <GlubGlub101> Thought Ska said he'd retire when Shroud did xD
[7:11:30] <+affliction_who> Shroud retiring was the best decision he coulda done
[7:11:45] <lemonemesis> agreed
[7:12:10] <KritikaL17> For Shroud yeah, since he's earing the $ on streaming
[7:12:24] <kushflava> @stormedbypizza say something dumb again

[7:12:48] <+itsjustmatt123> i wonder what n0thing will do
[7:12:54] <+affliction_who> Good for his mental health too..... it takes a lot of energy to deal with the pressure to preform
[7:13:07] <pepepigp> i hope c9 can win against comp / luminosity so we can see rematch bo3
[7:13:21] <GlubGlub101> Heard Nothing might take up coaching
[7:13:24] <+affliction_who> N0thing is casting/looking for another team I think
[7:13:31] <kushflava> @pepepigp is that a b01?
[7:13:52] <Dieseldogg> wtf are these casters
[7:13:54] <scaryshow_> c9 never wins
[7:14:04] <scaryshow_> replace skadoodle
[7:14:14] <kushflava> i could see nothing just taking a leave of absence, and just casting. I dont see him joing a different NA team than c9
[7:14:16] <lemonemesis> no
[7:14:30] <GlubGlub101> Skadaddy is god
[7:14:32] <lemonemesis> skadoodle is a very good awper
[7:14:46] <Dieseldogg> ska is good
[7:14:47] <scaryshow_> eh
[7:14:54] <+affliction_who> You also gotta remember that nothing has been playing competitively for over a decade... sometimes you just gotta move on
[7:14:56] <+itsjustmatt123> ska makes the best decisions on c9
[7:15:00] <scaryshow_> stewie can awp
[7:15:13] <scaryshow_> id get another playmaker
[7:15:17] <GlubGlub101> Can't lurk well with an awp
[7:15:18] <lemonemesis> but stewie is entry and igl
[7:15:24] <Dieseldogg> you are a bot
[7:15:30] <scaryshow_> @GlubGlub101 true
[7:15:45] <+affliction_who> Tarik and rush are supposed to entry instead, I think. Stew is much better mid round
[7:15:48] <scaryshow_> idk i think they need something new, i dont think tarik and rush are the answers
[7:15:54] <Dieseldogg> skaaa
[7:15:59] <GlubGlub101> Ska just does way better under pressure
[7:16:13] <GlubGlub101> Thrives for clutches
[7:16:18] <+itsjustmatt123> SKA SO DISCIPLINED
[7:16:28] <Jumpshott_Lol> when was this game played?
[7:16:41] <+affliction_who> Like 7 hours ago
[7:16:42] <PterodactyllL> @itsjustmatt123 and camper
[7:16:46] <ezrang1> IMMORTALS WIN
[7:16:47] <kushflava> people are so quick to remove ska, but who tf would you get to replace him. theres no one as good or better to replace
[7:17:01] <+itsjustmatt123> @PterodactyllL hes the awper???
[7:17:02] <PterodactyllL> immortls crlhhh
[7:17:27] <kushflava> complaining about camping in csgo haHAA
[7:17:27] <GlubGlub101> NA lacks in good known awpers in my opinion
[7:17:29] <Mat0dan> @kushhhh1 m0e? Kappa
