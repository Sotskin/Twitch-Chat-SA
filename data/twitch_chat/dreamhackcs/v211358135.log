[2:41:39] <m1quuuu> What is this map? Looks like csgo mirage
[2:41:50] <FranSwire> its mirage
[2:42:03] <dBierschenk> it is mirage xD
[2:42:24] <m1quuuu> 1.6 cs didnt have mirage. Is this some new maps etc things ?
[2:42:50] <stjernennn> wtf
[2:42:52] <FranSwire> cs 1.6 had mirage
[2:43:11] <dBierschenk> lol 1.6 had mirage ^^ the map comes later in mappool
[2:43:17] <m1quuuu> Why i cant remember it, lul
[2:43:18] <RaffarDolby> nostalgic
[2:44:55] <aduyeah> anyone knows who are casting?

[2:49:18] <QueenToasty1> Lol
[2:49:21] <zZade> ?
[2:50:12] <stavik69> this was mirage in 2k12 though
[2:50:13] <zZade> @prutlars47 poderia ir trabalhar? obrigado
[2:50:14] <anhtuan0296> good old days :)
[2:50:50] <caycagra> why 1.6 ?
[2:51:12] <anhtuan0296> why not :p
[2:51:22] <zZade> @caycagra why not?
[2:52:07] <ryanjf1234> I‚Äôm curious why they were playing 1.6 in 2012 when CSGO and CSS were out?
[2:52:23] <Corkyy97> CSGO came out 2012
[2:52:30] <pepenzie> coz 1.6 was still superior
[2:52:37] <Gate1312Nine> cs 1.6 >>> cs:go
[2:52:38] <Corkyy97> and CSS have never been the big E-sport game
[2:52:56] <saemzt> CSS never became big
[2:53:07] <Corkyy97> first around 2013-2014 CSGO e-sport began to rise
[2:53:07] <ryanjf1234> But counter strike in general was. When did they stop 1.6 and go to CSGO
[2:53:17] <ryanjf1234> Okay
[2:53:19] <SoapBtw> what makes 1.6 so good?
[2:53:30] <SoapBtw> never have played it
[2:53:30] <saemzt> csgo came out 2 months after DHS2012
[2:53:36] <zZade> @sp3ncer gameplay
[2:53:58] <Gate1312Nine> @sp3ncer the fact that it's a much harder game than cs:go, the gameplay is also enjoyable
[2:54:04] <peshohamala> cs 1.6 is so much smoother even at 60fps feeels smoother than csgo at 300fps
[2:54:12] <Bandhis> @sp3ncer the feeling of the game, and that its a classic
[2:54:36] <stavik69> I didn't play games that much back in 1.6 era so i'm just a csgo player.
[2:54:41] <Gate1312Nine> on cs 1.6 you couldn't run and walk with a P90 just like you can in cs:go lol
[2:54:50] <domonne> Did they dodged css in esport ? Start watching cs in 2014 so idk
[2:54:55] <zZade> @peshohamala monitors 4:3 120hz
[2:55:19] <b0redb0y> why are there no gun switching animations..
[2:55:23] <ryanjf1234> Apparently CSS gun mechanics were way worse than 1.6.
[2:55:32] <saemzt> because the game is old as hell
[2:55:37] <pepenzie> b0redb0y: hltv bug
[2:55:41] <Corkyy97> CSS was just more a casual game, that was not really made for E-sport
[2:55:43] <+Exorzon1> That's carn and dsn casting right?
[2:55:50] <+Exorzon1> Sounds like them
[2:55:55] <Bandhis> yup
[2:56:07] <+fantaseeee> ahh 1.6
[2:56:14] <ryanjf1234> CSS had the best mods though out of all three.
[2:56:15] <+fantaseeee> the good ole days
[2:56:19] <b0redb0y> is this old man chat LUL
[2:56:36] <peshohamala> in 1,6 theres no BS peekers advantage like in csgo and player models move slower so you cant get killed from someone with 120 ping before you can see him
[2:56:41] <+fantaseeee> back when edward was good
[2:56:44] <Corkyy97> this is the OG cs chat xD
[2:56:55] <r1val27> @b0redb0y hltv models
[2:57:02] <Corkyy97> back when SpawN and Heaton killed people xD
[2:57:04] <peshohamala> @fantaseeee back when markeloff was good lol
[2:57:13] <Bandhis> I miss the quickscopes with awp :(
[2:57:21] <+fantaseeee> karrigan still shit though kappa
[2:57:24] <migueeello> so fuckingg beatuiful
[2:57:33] <b0redb0y> holy shit thats a name i haven't heard off in a while @peshohamala
[2:57:42] <ryanjf1234> IÔ∏è like how Zeus is back on navi. Back to his roots.
[2:57:43] <pepenzie> thats the RC in fnatic? RC coke ?
[2:57:46] <r1val27> how old are u guys ?
[2:58:06] <Corkyy97> almost 21 here :D
[2:58:09] <Bandhis> @pepenzie RaidCall if I am not mistaken
[2:58:13] <+Exorzon1> RC = Raidcall
[2:58:20] <Tominaut> 22
[2:58:22] <r1val27> 26
[2:58:23] <peshohamala> @r1val27 19, been playing cs 1,6 since 11, csgo since 17 :D
[2:58:30] <Corkyy97> played my first 1.6 game when i was 6 years old :P
[2:58:50] <stavik69> 21
[2:58:54] <pepenzie> 30 here, played fnatic on lan but not navi :/
[2:58:56] <Corkyy97> and never really liked CSS
[2:58:57] <+fantaseeee> old mirage had a better layout less bs corner's to check
[2:59:00] <zZade> 20
[2:59:02] <b0redb0y> i started at 10, family thought I'd grow up to kill people LUL
[2:59:14] <r1val27> same lol
[2:59:20] <ryanjf1234> CSS mods were amazing. Why i played it.
[2:59:21] <peshohamala> same hahaha
[2:59:23] <diegomancan7> SO MANY PEOPLE
[2:59:29] <matene__> pistol god edward
[2:59:36] <Corkyy97> b0redb0y i think many people tough that XD
[2:59:46] <r1val27> good old deagle
[2:59:50] <b0redb0y> sadly didn't kill anyone FeelsBadMan
[2:59:51] <diegomancan7> deagle was so op
[2:59:52] <stavik69> I liked deagle in the other games, deagle in csgo is so shit
[2:59:55] <peshohamala> good
[3:00:08] <peshohamala> good old days when you could spam the deagle
[3:00:14] <Corkyy97> one thing i like with CS 1.6 is the spray pattern..... there where none xD
[3:00:15] <@Moobot> Follow DreamHack on twitter.com/dreamhackcsgo - facebook.com/DreamHackCSGO - instagram.com/dreamhack - snapchat.com/add/dreamhacklive
[3:00:28] <diegomancan7> how bad was the tournaments back then
[3:00:32] <+fantaseeee> FOR ZEST
[3:00:38] <diegomancan7> ZES
[3:00:38] <b0redb0y> 1.6 deagle better than csgo deagle imo
[3:00:42] <+fantaseeee> not even calling his zues
[3:00:44] <diegomancan7> NOT ZEUS ZESS
[3:00:48] <stavik69> the current deagle is just a gamble to use
[3:00:49] <pepenzie> Corkyy97: nice bullshit, look up youtube vid with patterns
[3:00:52] <diegomancan7> ZEWS
[3:00:55] <+fantaseeee> 1.6 deagle was super accurate aon all shots
[3:01:02] <r1val27> @diegomancan7 if u watch spawn they were pretty fun
[3:01:04] <jeez1king> @Corkyy97 there was recoil
[3:01:47] <Corkyy97> still bullets landed random, never really been an spray pattern its first really came later
[3:02:20] <Corkyy97> ofc there have been a little but, 1.6 had the most random spray of all CS
[3:02:21] <RyleeVulich16> god i miss 1.6
[3:02:52] <r1val27> cs go is waay more randdom
[3:03:13] <r1val27> and the registration is rng too
[3:03:14] <peshohamala> cs 1.6 deagle had 100% accuracy on the second bullet if you spam it quickly the second bullet was more accurate than the first one
[3:04:02] <Voldson> Where gameplay > skins
[3:04:18] <Bandhis> the HE grenades were op aswell
[3:04:45] <r1val27> yup and they floated lol
[3:04:55] <fabbygames> that was awkward af
[3:05:44] <projefkell> @s1mpleof Hello :p
[3:05:55] <+fantaseeee> i actually wish he grenades were stronger in csgo
[3:06:04] <+fantaseeee> should one shot right next too them
[3:06:28] <peshohamala> @fantaseeee stronger ??? man I cant get anywhere near bannan on new inferno withot them being stronger haha :D
[3:07:07] <+fantaseeee> spoiler fnatic wins
[3:07:23] <Bandhis> also the glock in cs was shit compared to the glock in csgo
[3:08:06] <Voldson> Go moon2P
[3:08:07] <+fantaseeee> glock is still shit in csgo
[3:08:09] <Corkyy97> one thing i found really hard to figure out in CS 1.6 was the radar xD
[3:08:32] <+Exorzon1> The 1.6 glock still gives me horrible flashbacks
[3:08:43] <Corkyy97> last update with glock just made it the best spray pistol in CSGO
[3:08:46] <Bandhis> @Exorzon1 same
[3:09:06] <Corkyy97> especially after they nerfed tec 9
[3:09:10] <+Exorzon1> I do miss it's burst though
[3:09:12] <gksrjsgml> accuracy gone bad??
[3:09:17] <+Exorzon1> And the famas burst, it was glorious in 1.6
[3:09:48] <Corkyy97> also you could literately WB every where xD
[3:09:56] <peshohamala> @Exorzon1 back when the famas was actually a viable weapon :D in csgo i rather use a cz or deagle than famas haha
[3:10:03] <stuck_on_rank_1> nuke wallbangs LuL
[3:10:20] <+Exorzon1> @peshohamala Word
[3:10:45] <Corkyy97> if you knew where they was on nuke, you would never been seen xD

[1 day, 22:35:49] <ellak1234> he can, just not that time. He is a badass awp'r.
[1 day, 22:38:03] <Fortschritt1> again, basic shots and he coudnt hit em
[1 day, 22:38:30] <Schewux> have you seen all of the match ?
[1 day, 22:38:33] <+Papynice> he should've just hid
[1 day, 22:38:46] <ellak1234> maybe had a bad match? i dont know how much CS u follow, but it may blow ur mind he actually played a couple more matches then this one..
[1 day, 22:38:52] <eipaa> it doesent matter if hes badass if he is not consistent
[1 day, 22:39:17] <eipaa> and draken is not consistent player

[1 day, 22:40:28] <eipaa> Thats opinion, everyone has one.
[1 day, 22:40:41] <ellak1234> if the talent surpasses the consistancy its worth holding on too, caus thats a time thing.
[1 day, 22:41:07] <Fortschritt1> he always hit the flicks and amazing shots, but not the basics
[1 day, 22:41:08] <eipaa> Yh, im not going to have a conversation with u after what u just said
