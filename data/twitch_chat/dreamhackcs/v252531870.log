[0:00:32] <Voxdalian> @ext44zy Yes, but in semis. I don't think Na'Vi will win against Mouz, so C9 will get dunked on Mouz in semis, since Gambit isn't much opposition. Too bad C9 got all the lucky picks though.

[2:41:31] <Kundihnusnazachode> *this is not
[2:41:33] <sodastereobb> @Lightzor well they werent doing well with taco at all either
[2:41:35] <+Zurppie> Stewie probably doesn‚Äôt even get along with the brazilians culturewise
[2:41:43] <iletyoudie00> @ahmad_1o check the title dude.
[2:41:44] <juggy_bravo> someone has to bait for cold
[2:41:45] <BeansNTaters96> you have to think before you speak if its not your main language, thats too much
[2:41:54] <+brainless007> GUYS mouz played this afternoon
[2:41:57] <raphovisky> believe that when each of the players find his position (as they are trying different stuff) they will be able to win more matches
[2:42:00] <+brainless007> its RERUN
[2:42:04] <sodastereobb> @iletyoudie00 yeah, they have only been going down
[2:42:04] <sjappieketser> Still 0-0. see right top of the sreen...
[2:42:04] <@Moobot> Enter the DreamHack CS:GO giveaway here - dh.je/giveaway
[2:42:05] <Lightzor> @sodastereobb But on my opinion, they were better with him.
[2:42:05] <+Zurppie> It says rerun for a reason
[2:42:11] <chufonator> Stewie should go to brazil n' learn some favela style portuguese charm
[2:42:21] <chufonator> brazilian charm sry manitos
[2:42:32] <sodastereobb> @Lightzor in 2015 and 2016 yeah but not since the end for 2017
[2:42:34] <sjappieketser> rerun is tournament sponsor i gues... Dork!
[2:42:36] <iletyoudie00> @Zurppie that doesn't make any sense mate. that's = 0. the problem is probably roles & / communication. ( in my opinion )
[2:42:37] <Lightzor> portuguese charm LUL
[2:42:42] <Arrold_> it's live they forgot to change the title
[2:42:50] <Morb1d_> I predict 16-10 on Cache, 16-6 Mirage to Mouse, maybe I should put a bet, can you bet during a live match?
[2:42:59] <+Spinebreaker666> i rly hope Mouz will win a major
[2:43:03] <Smokeyx223> did cloud 9 play today??

[2:43:22] <sodastereobb> @Morb1d_ xD
[2:43:25] <Lightzor> @sodastereobb I agree! But I dont think all the bad things were Taco's responsibility
[2:43:27] <+cammaslamma> twitch needs a mute feature for some many in chat

[7:17:30] <+mankman1> rush is a better entry than stew ever was
[7:17:34] <awebby10> shroud deag reincarnate
[7:17:46] <2person> FNS>Stewie
[7:17:51] <awebby10> stew is shit currently
[7:17:53] <+chazhorn11> FNS is making rush play like stan is his igl again
[7:18:03] <koggg> the rumor is that stewie and skadoodle didn't get along because stewie thought ska didn't work hard enough
[7:18:09] <+OfficialTJ> guardians toggle was broke
[7:18:10] <koggg> So when Stew left, Ska came back
[7:18:24] <IGameWithNoName> oh....
[7:18:25] <Katpubes> stew was the problem
[7:18:28] <+mankman1> not that dramatic
[7:18:35] <+Xxpowmanxx> ska decided he wanted a break awhile ago
[7:18:36] <+mankman1> stew said they never fought
[7:18:45] <koggg> well, so long as stew said that
[7:18:46] <+Xxpowmanxx> bc he wasnt feeling confident
[7:19:20] <+Xxpowmanxx> ppl betting on faze rn
[7:19:20] <anarchicjester> >wanted a break but one of them didnt agree >where have i seen this before
[7:19:21] <IGameWithNoName> Clpud9 isn‚Äôt my favorite team anymore :(
[7:19:21] <+mankman1> check stewies twitter @koggg
[7:19:26] <koggg> you've got a lot to learn about the world if you think just because a famous person said something on twitter means it's true
[7:19:44] <elkatrazx> Why does it matter, you guys will never know the real reasoning and that‚Äôs locker room stuff that doesn‚Äôt leave their mouths
[7:19:45] <+mankman1> loool its a link to an HLTV interview
[7:19:56] <+mankman1> you are a high schooler or a weirdo @koggg
[7:19:56] <+Xxpowmanxx> when it comes to arguments i usually judge based on external sources IE other people
[7:19:57] <koggg> lol so he said it to a camera
[7:20:11] <da_legit_cat> hi
[7:20:13] <koggg> are you 12? lol famous people lie to squash drama all the time
[7:20:23] <typpapulsa> stfu
[7:20:32] <+mankman1> an obsessive fans inject drama
[7:20:34] <Katpubes> stormy daniel speaks the truth
[7:20:45] <da_legit_cat> does anyone play cago in here?
[7:20:48] <+Xxpowmanxx> koggg during a live interview you can tell though
[7:20:51] <koggg> Yeah, some obsessive fan I am here watching a restream instead of live lol

[7:21:58] <fadhiln123> ***
[7:22:01] <+mankman1> something else to consider about stew is that SK pays their players way more than C9
[7:22:02] <+ssamwatson> nothing was talking about how it started back when he was asked to step down
[7:22:03] <anarchicjester> @koggg that's also going on there

[7:26:20] <Saskard> tbh if u are arguing in twitch chat about 2 e sport players arguing, cant rly tell ppl to grow up
[7:26:26] <+mankman1> 420 iq
[7:26:43] <anarchicjester> this seems bleek for twitch chat as his IQ is currently increasing with every word he types
[7:26:49] <kawaiiboy69> blaze it fgg0tz
[7:27:01] <Saskard> yea he might tie on 202
[7:27:01] <plebstene> why is this not live?

[7:27:12] <awebby10> it is live

[7:28:17] <Hasanenk> 16-14
[7:28:22] <Saskard> a ''kick me'' or '' give me awp'' would also work
[7:28:29] <kawaiiboy69> herro
[7:28:36] <anarchicjester> "my team is noob"- in all chat
[7:28:40] <Hasanenk> 16-14 for c9

[7:30:18] <awebby10> skadaddy
[7:30:23] <elkatrazx> Wow

[7:30:32] <Saskard> he cant combo 2 of those so would be at least OT for us

[7:31:17] <awebby10> complexity and clg

[7:34:03] <+Sweet_Easy> forsenSS
[7:34:15] <extremeunreal> ankle breaker lol
[7:34:17] <+tootergray34> man stewie and SK already out, he has to be second guessing his decision
[7:34:20] <anarchicjester> nani de fuk?
[7:34:24] <+tootergray34> but ska said he was done if stewie stayed
[7:34:37] <+Sweet_Easy> stewie played like ass
[7:34:38] <+Fazeel147> @tootergray34 why did he say that
[7:34:48] <xFiremanskOffcial> ska.never said that
[7:34:49] <+Sweet_Easy> was he toxic or did he and ska just not get along
[7:34:52] <lucedoke> Who wins this?
[7:34:59] <awebby10> stewies just an arrogant kid
[7:35:03] <+tootergray34> I think him and ska just didn't get along
[7:35:16] <+tootergray34> easy to see, ska so quiet and chill, stew so loud
[7:35:18] <+Sweet_Easy> gotcha
[7:35:27] <+mankman1> where did ska say that? @tootergray34
[7:35:27] <anarchicjester> Ska told stew to open his eyes and stew left
[7:35:38] <+Fazeel147> @tootergray34 do you have a source?
[7:35:50] <xFiremanskOffcial> stew was held back by c9
[7:35:51] <+Oculate> LUL
[7:35:56] <lucedoke> Stewie is only 20, he has a lot to learn
[7:36:08] <+tootergray34> FNX on C9 makes much more sense, once he gets a groove with the gang, him and valens already have background together
[7:36:10] <awebby10> lmaooooooo
[7:36:19] <Katpubes> stew was the problem
[7:36:25] <anarchicjester> SNX?

[7:58:30] <+chipskilIed> Cloud9 outplayed faze
[7:58:31] <awebby10> fns underrated but he is not a fragger
[7:58:33] <Sabueso> lol
[7:58:39] <awebby10> tier 2 reactions
[7:58:40] <PurpIeYoshi> Gambit good but hell nah
[7:58:46] <+AceGaming001> You act liek fns is bad @awebby10
[7:58:46] <+tootergray34> fns doesn't need to be a fragger though

[7:59:24] <+Koisong> passive
[7:59:30] <+enraginangel> no hats!
[7:59:34] <+tootergray34> shroud and rush more comparable
[7:59:39] <awebby10> shroud can actually aim though and his reactions are insane
[7:59:48] <tobiastind1> cant compare anyone to the king of reddit tho
[7:59:53] <awebby10> I was gonna say him and rush
[8:00:03] <+Compl9x> fns looks like he is on drugs
[8:00:18] <ekkzbrand> and he is

[8:00:23] <tobiastind1> @Compl9x reminds me of a nicer version of dennis
[8:00:25] <awebby10> shroud was inconsistent but when he was on top of his game he was unbeatable
[8:00:27] <SolsticeSPH> tarik3 tarik4
[8:00:31] <+edices> its adderall infused gaming water not drugs
[8:00:35] <vollbartmartin> auti with his headmoves tho

[8:00:43] <awebby10> neckimatic
[8:00:45] <Afunnyjoke1> Shroud could be a top player in the world if he had the passion for cs as much as he has a passion on pubg/fornite/streaming
[8:00:46] <selim9521> can we have memory case in this stream?
[8:01:03] <awebby10> I agree
[8:01:08] <+p0sting> @afunnyjoke1 shroud is too Online
[8:01:10] <+edices> Shroud makes hundreds of thousands of dollars streaming he doesn't need to go pro
[8:01:24] <tobiastind1> he makes more off of streaming
[8:01:26] <Afunnyjoke1> shroud makes 100k plus a month on just subs
[8:01:27] <STEWBALLZ96> @Afunnyjoke1 are you okay mate? he played comp CS for like 2 years

[8:02:01] <+GrooveControl> wombleShoots wombleShoots wombleShoots eskeddit
[8:02:09] <STEWBALLZ96> maybe he realised the potential of streaming
[8:02:11] <Afunnyjoke1> after sean left he started to slip away as a top player
[8:02:11] <selim9521> can we have memory case in this stream?
[8:02:13] <PurpIeYoshi> stewie in SK be like why did i leave LUL

[8:02:40] <+Koisong> nah
[8:02:41] <STEWBALLZ96> yeah i know, but he saw the full potential of streaming
[8:02:49] <+Koisong> twitch takes half of that
[8:02:55] <STEWBALLZ96> imagine playing this shit game for 9 hours a day every day
[8:03:00] <tobiastind1> ye. i removed half off it
[8:03:02] <Mod_SMOrc> Nah twitch doesnt
[8:03:03] <+p0sting> @koisong he took half off
[8:03:10] <awebby10> exactly I would get tired of it too
[8:03:13] <Mod_SMOrc> They take like 30%
[8:03:13] <tobiastind1> 42k subs * 2,5
[8:03:19] <tobiastind1> they take half
[8:03:22] <BreadWarmer> Dust 2 back in map Pool!!!!
[8:03:25] <Mod_SMOrc> Nope
[8:03:29] <+enraginangel> twitch takes half for pleb partners. gives most of it to top streamers
[8:03:30] <+eatdatrice16> the more subs you have the more twitch gives per sub
[8:03:32] <VishyRF> twitch takes 1.5$ fr each sub
[8:03:32] <BreadWarmer> Yes
[8:03:33] <+tootergray34> depends, if you are popular streamer can take 3 twitch 2
[8:03:34] <STEWBALLZ96> they dont take half if you have a shit load of subs
[8:03:36] <awebby10> twitch streamers get 2.50 a sub and a sub is 5.00
[8:03:37] <+Koisong> twitch taks 50% of every sub
[8:03:38] <+RooTwoo> depends on the streamer
[8:03:44] <STEWBALLZ96> ninja makes like $3.50 from every sub
[8:03:47] <tobiastind1> well they do... xD
[8:03:49] <+RooTwoo> that‚Äôs not true for every koinsong
[8:03:53] <awebby10> its always 50% no matter who you are
[8:03:59] <Mod_SMOrc> No its not awe
[8:03:59] <+RooTwoo> incorrect LUL
[8:04:00] <BreadWarmer> They don't take 50% of every single sub
[8:04:00] <minddistortion> weedFaded weedFaded weedFaded weedFaded weedFaded
[8:04:00] <+eatdatrice16> no
[8:04:05] <awebby10> why would they lose money
[8:04:07] <vy0lent> its different for each streamer LUL
[8:04:07] <STEWBALLZ96> classic brain dead twitch chat LUL
[8:04:10] <SolsticeSPH> tarikD tarikD tarikD tarikD
[8:04:16] <+Macklin_> 11-20 oof
[8:04:18] <Afunnyjoke1> For some streamers as big as shroud he gets more then half
[8:04:19] <BreadWarmer> the more subs you get eventually the percent they take of those new subs is less
[8:04:20] <+eatdatrice16> $2.50 is minimum
[8:04:21] <@Moobot> Enter the DreamHack CS:GO giveaway here - dh.je/giveaway
[8:04:23] <tobiastind1> i know device personally, and he makes 2,5 each. not sure if its different for other streamers lol
[8:04:25] <+RooTwoo> because they still make a metric buttload of money
[8:04:26] <Afunnyjoke1> he props get like more then 3 bucks per sub
[8:04:28] <Mod_SMOrc> How would twitch lose money off off a sub
[8:04:36] <Mod_SMOrc> Off of*
[8:04:39] <+fxde4> @awebby10 you're so wrong LUL
[8:04:46] <awebby10> potential money earned....
[8:04:50] <awebby10> obviously not a loss
[8:04:52] <vy0lent> they give more popular streamers a better ratio to encourage to stick around - the last thing twitch wants is ninja moving to a new platform
[8:05:01] <Afunnyjoke1> ^^^^
[8:05:02] <BreadWarmer> @awebby10 you're not very smart are you
[8:05:05] <+AceGaming001> @awebby10 likes to pretend he knows what hes talking about
[8:05:10] <+Koisong> i mean
[8:05:12] <innerfire77> who is shrimp anyonay ResidentSleeper a guy playing boring ass game ResidentSleeper and average pro player ResidentSleeper
[8:05:13] <elkatrazx> They lose money off prime subs but ninja said he gets 3.50 a sub and it‚Äôs different for each streamer
[8:05:22] <+Koisong> what else platforms are there LUL
[8:05:25] <elkatrazx> 3 50
[8:05:25] <Honkerbeeper> Nice retake rbh
[8:05:30] <tobiastind1> actually. minimum is 50/50. But big streamers can get a better deal like 60/40. just googled it
[8:05:31] <BreadWarmer> Azuboo
[8:05:33] <Honkerbeeper> B site mirage is hard to retake
[8:05:33] <awebby10> who tells you guys these things....
[8:05:35] <Creepn2> Wtf is fns on c9 for...
[8:05:42] <Honkerbeeper> igl
[8:05:44] <Afunnyjoke1> If you are some normal ass streamer with 100 subs you best believe your getting 2.50
[8:05:48] <BreadWarmer> No one said otherwise @tobiastind1
[8:05:55] <pathaloo> @Creepn2 he replaced stew
[8:05:58] <+Densonbr0> @Creepn2 they need a igl
[8:05:58] <tobiastind1> i did xD
[8:05:59] <+edices> stewie died unexpectedly so they had to get a stand in
[8:05:59] <BreadWarmer> Get your reading glasses on buddy
[8:06:01] <Afunnyjoke1> but when your shroud with over 2 million followers and 40k subs you get more lo
[8:06:11] <elkatrazx> Ninja literally said it in an interview with Nbc or whoever he had that interview with lol
[8:06:15] <+jjgcs> fns and quickswitching lul
[8:06:19] <Creepn2> is tarik not good enough to igl anymore or??? havnt followed the scene since the major
[8:06:23] <+strix_bb> stewie died? i thought avici died
[8:06:25] <STEWBALLZ96> yeah stewie was on holiday in Oman and died
[8:06:37] <BreadWarmer> CZ-75 killed him
[8:06:41] <STEWBALLZ96> @Creepn2 i dont think he enjoyed the role thats all
[8:06:46] <Mod_SMOrc> L u L
[8:06:48] <awebby10> I just don't understand how twitch can afford to pay these streamers
[8:06:51] <BreadWarmer> wake me up when it's all over!
[8:06:53] <+cadmum> @Creepn2 they wanted him to be able to focus more on his plays so they free him off being an igl
[8:06:55] <tobiastind1> lets just put it like this... shroud could buy all of us a nice car
[8:06:56] <Mod_SMOrc> Cz never b nerfed
[8:07:00] <awebby10> besides being owned by amazon
[8:07:03] <Afunnyjoke1> they dont pay the streamers @awebby10
[8:07:04] <Creepn2> "I took a pill in Ibiza, to show stewie I was cool"
[8:07:10] <+eatdatrice16> @awebby10 they don't
[8:07:14] <BreadWarmer> @awebby10 what do you mean twitch paying streamers?
[8:07:18] <Mod_SMOrc> ?????
[8:07:24] <BreadWarmer> you mean amazon prime?
[8:07:25] <Creepn2> what else have I missed? I know about stew to sk
[8:07:29] <Afunnyjoke1> @awebby10 The viewers pay the streamers you uneducated fiik
[8:07:31] <Mod_SMOrc> Viewers pay twitch they pay streamers
[8:07:31] <BreadWarmer> Because amazon prime cost MONEY

[11:37:29] <Pfare> Feels like im the only one who thinks. 64 tick is better than 128
[11:37:30] <+toqqle> if you‚Äôve never played on third party servers you wouldn‚Äôt know tho, the flash/smoke throws are different because of the difference lmao
[11:37:31] <taktukoz> JW F@T P1G Kappa
[11:37:39] <Ishivara> How about valve gets better server or releases a new csgo instead of letting this one die? üßê

[11:50:16] <+Rasikelli21> cs 1.6 > cs:go ;)
[11:50:30] <Pfare> @nck_ its better to swap to fortnite early
[11:50:30] <Ishivara> @probotted2 just to change it up a bit, not necessarily completely drop it
[11:50:34] <yash_uppal> seriously?? how many players play 1.6 or czero

[11:52:23] <aryanando> no one give a damn about tf 2

[11:52:27] <Exzii7> Let's keep it real here guys, TF2 is irrelevant to the most of us.
[11:52:28] <yash_uppal> csgo can only be replaced by another cs not any other game
[11:52:46] <Pfare> @yash_uppal a new cs will not work

[11:57:55] <grantclark> BR games arent optimal for pro scenes, too many solo stars, too many decent players that can wreck in a team, too much rng
[11:58:03] <Face___palm> im pretty sure one of the definitions of the battle royale genre is "casual"
[11:58:08] <+b1gtoe> fortnite is just a way better game
[11:58:13] <thatcapehero> Battle royal and over watch will never be a good pro scene. It is too messy
[11:58:16] <+b1gtoe> takes way more skill
