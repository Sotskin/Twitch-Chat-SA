[2:14:38] <+DoctaZaius> at least these commercials are badass
[2:14:45] <xX_Excruciation_Xx> lol
[2:15:03] <+DoctaZaius> better than pre-cinema car commercials for sure
[2:15:04] <+Yamr3> Hilarious
[2:15:05] <xX_Excruciation_Xx> They stepped up their game
[2:15:24] <+DoctaZaius> is this the water break?

[2:16:16] <+Official_STiTCH> oh issa rerun
[2:17:06] <+Yamr3> Why can't these commercials show off gaming content and not some lame product?
[2:17:14] <ChampTheGreat_> idk
[2:17:19] <+Yamr3> Like that PC case. Literally learn nothing that's in it or what it can handle.
[2:17:39] <tanebb> @Yamr3 ikr.. sucks
[2:17:49] <+Yamr3> Piss poor advertising to a gaming community where, for the most part, know some stuff about PC parts.
[2:17:52] <Divergence63> It‚Äôs live?
[2:18:02] <+Yamr3> Like, I mean, not trying to be mean but this is piss poor marketing.

[2:19:58] <stfano1337> @kingduckyftw How do u know that?
[2:20:00] <+Yamr3> Of course not @violentreflex . We need that space for the 40 photographers to take 2000 photos when there's live video nowadays
[2:20:09] <KINGDuckyFTW> RERUN
[2:20:33] <tanebb> @stfano1337 i bet he has watched this live, and now he's here to spoil xdd
[2:20:54] <tsmstevefrench> this is live, the sponsor is ReRun

[2:21:32] <tanebb> Ayyyyyyyy LUL
[2:21:40] <+Yamr3> Gotta keep the view count up for advertiser payments
[2:23:28] <ZoumBaDouWowPifPif> 5k for Major LUL dead game
[2:24:09] <munzevid> Dead game but ƒ± watch everytime LUL
[2:24:10] <elcazadorriley > wait this is live?
[2:24:19] <spazzzzin> yes a live rerun
[2:24:21] <ggg573608> xd
[2:24:30] <+Yamr3> Not as dead as Rainbow 6 Siege reruns lmao
[2:24:32] <elcazadorriley > -___________________________-
[2:24:46] <elcazadorriley > everyone is asleep in the west tho
[2:24:57] <spazzzzin> r6 is too buggy to be taken seriously
[2:25:10] <elcazadorriley > West makes up majority of the population no?
[2:25:45] <spazzzzin> like, in the world?
[2:26:05] <Honkerbeeper> i swear cobblestone is so slow paced I hate this map
[2:26:07] <elcazadorriley > Of this game lol
[2:26:24] <+Yamr3> In CSGO? Not sure. I think CSGO is becoming quite popular in South America
[2:26:47] <ThomasBlomkal> csgo is dying man
[2:26:49] <tsmstevefrench> they have llamas in SA though, not PC's
[2:27:04] <Captjack2000> Do you guys feel like the pro scene is slowing down and is kind of boring now
[2:27:06] <elcazadorriley > yeah true cant play CSGO on a Llama
[2:27:12] <Mistermacys> 60 TICK LLAMAS?
[2:27:16] <elcazadorriley > It may be dying, but I still think it has a few years
[2:27:21] <Mistermacys> damn caps
[2:27:29] <+Applying> does anyone know why cs got lame and died so hard this year
[2:27:35] <elcazadorriley > before the game itself is dead, pro scene may die first
[2:27:35] <spazzzzin> do they even have electricity in favelas
[2:27:37] <+Yamr3> It's the same teams that make it to the finals every time. Literally no change at each competition.
[2:27:37] <Gameboyy> Still better than Destiny 2 LUL
[2:27:53] <Captjack2000> I dont know I'm a VP fan so it's not really prime time for me to watch
[2:28:00] <+Yamr3> Then it's the usual team names. There's no rivalries.
[2:28:00] <ThomasBlomkal> I used to watch every pro game, but now as cpt said, it feels now boring etc
[2:28:21] <munzevid> This game need to Source 2
[2:28:23] <elcazadorriley > Im actually new to CS, only been playing for a month or so
[2:28:25] <+sinn___> esports are over, badminton is the future
[2:28:29] <munzevid> Needs
[2:28:30] <Gameboyy> Me too @elcazadorriley
[2:28:40] <elcazadorriley > I think if they added 5 new maps at once, the game would spike hard
[2:28:42] <Captjack2000> yeah ESL NY last year was VP vs NAVI, great game, and this year it was FaZe vs Liquid, which was no contest
[2:28:43] <Quickchase> AH AH AH AH staying alive staying alive
[2:28:47] <ThomasBlomkal> llama races are the nes CSGO
[2:28:50] <spazzzzin> they can't focus on improving their content while they're trying to cash in on this shit while it's getting hot
[2:28:50] <UnusProximus> I like trains!
[2:28:56] <+Applying> i miss when csgo had betting and actual good teams
[2:28:58] <tsmstevefrench> i fucked everybody up in badminton HS gym class. won tourney.
[2:28:59] <elcazadorriley > Wont happen, but would help so much
[2:29:06] <+Sahnsan> does this caster have a stutter
[2:29:09] <Mistermacys> Are there fewer live tournaments now? I swear, the Montain Dew League is the only one with weekly livestreams
[2:29:13] <+Yamr3> They ain't gonna shit with the game.
[2:29:14] <DRAGONvix> sk is better team of world, with brazilian players
[2:29:15] <ThomasBlomkal> betting in CSGO was the biggest bullshit in history
[2:29:40] <elcazadorriley > So, when are you guys going to sell your skins LUL
[2:29:41] <+Applying> but that was csgos peak lul
[2:29:51] <+Yamr3> Valve has no interest in doing anything until it benefits them or they start making less money.
[2:30:00] <ThomasBlomkal> what skins? i never spent a single cent on skins, im not stupid
[2:30:01] <Captjack2000> @elcazadorriley\s I sold them 2 months ago
[2:30:02] <Mistermacys> ^ that
[2:30:07] <home_taping> @elcazadorriley LUL i actually cashed everything out last week
[2:30:19] <elcazadorriley > Better cash out soon :^) since its dying
[2:30:52] <+sinn___> guys pls who wants some 1v1 at badminton
[2:30:54] <+Yamr3> Just noticed this is a Bo1
[2:30:57] <elcazadorriley > Cant wait for everyone to sell out, so then I can get a knife for cheap FeelsGoodMan
[2:30:58] <ChinesaApertada> no balls
[2:31:02] <+Yamr3> I hate it when matches are Bo1. Too short
[2:31:49] <+Yamr3> Won't die out because there's nothing to replace CSGO comparatively atm
[2:32:04] <ThomasBlomkal> pubg is coming
[2:32:16] <ThomasBlomkal> three times as popular as csgo nowadays
[2:32:18] <+Yamr3> Siege was a good effort but Ubisoft has no interest in fixing the game
[2:32:25] <+mike_wuz_here> tad different though
[2:32:32] <elcazadorriley > I think the overall mindset is changing for the general gaming populace, yest there is no direct replacement, but people love PUBG style open world
[2:32:37] <+Yamr3> PUBG is not CSGO and no not popular than CSGO. Just more streamers playing it
[2:32:37] <+sinn___> pubg boring af
[2:32:45] <+Cloudieskyy> NANI?
[2:32:49] <+Yamr3> PUBG is also god damn boring as shit
[2:32:53] <spazzzzin> pubg isn't even a complete game
[2:32:55] <+Yamr3> Likie watching paint drying
[2:33:00] <ThomasBlomkal> not popular as csgo? what planet do you live on?
[2:33:00] <munzevid> Pubg is best game on stability becaƒ±se ƒ± have 2x gtx 1080 titan
[2:33:01] <elcazadorriley > I think PUBG is so boring
[2:33:06] <Captjack2000> @spazzzzin neither is CSGO

[2:33:10] <jinglos> sick viewbots
[2:33:18] <elcazadorriley > also not as much skill as people make it out to take
[2:33:19] <+mike_wuz_here> 2 titan wont stop bad game optimization
[2:33:22] <ThomasBlomkal> csgo has 800k highest peek in last 6 months, PUBg has 1 800 k
[2:33:31] <ThomasBlomkal> "not as popular" rofl
[2:33:50] <spazzzzin> @Captjack2000 at least CSGO isn't deliberately labeled as an early access game that is literally not complete
[2:33:55] <jinglos> pubg is reddit hype, slowly dying until nobody plays it anymore
[2:33:58] <elcazadorriley > Congrats the circle shrank on you, you win, youre so good
[2:34:08] <munzevid> Pubg is so overrated
[2:34:09] <Captjack2000> look at steamDB player numbers and see that PUBG consistently has more players
[2:34:16] <+Applying> PogChamp
[2:34:17] <DarthScrub79> RIP
[2:34:24] <Honkerbeeper> that wasnt a noscope lmao
[2:34:26] <Captjack2000> @spazzzzin it was a joke but i see your point
[2:34:28] <ChinesaApertada> no scope? LUL
[2:34:28] <elcazadorriley > Depends on how good PUBG is on full release
[2:34:28] <spazzzzin> look at the early access tag
[2:34:35] <ThomasBlomkal> who said PUBG is dying please :DDDDDD if u donno shit, dont write
[2:34:44] <+Yamr3> Just looked, you're right has more concurrent and peak players
[2:34:52] <tanebb> @elcazadorriley\s if it never gets to a full release
[2:34:54] <elcazadorriley > I think they were saying it WILL die, not that it is
[2:34:54] <jinglos> check back in 6 months see how pubg does
[2:35:00] <jinglos> it will die
[2:35:00] <+Yamr3> I still wouldn't watch it nor look at a competitive scene for it.
[2:35:08] <spazzzzin> no one said it's dying, i said it's not complete, if you're going to interject at least learn to read first
[2:35:22] <+Yamr3> Also, keep in mind, that it's still relatively new. Most "popular" streamer games are top charts or get picked up when they're new.
[2:35:25] <ThomasBlomkal> actually PUBG despite all the problems had the most successful month last month, china is taking pubg very seriously
[2:35:36] <+sinn___> it will die as h1z1 did
[2:35:38] <ThomasBlomkal> who cares about streamers rofl
[2:35:41] <jinglos> they've already tried everything on pubg and it quickly becomes repetitive
[2:35:47] <Captjack2000> @Yamr3 They had some pro tournament thing and it is not esports ready AT ALL. It is nearly impossible to spectate 50+players and supply analysis
[2:35:48] <ThomasBlomkal> every game will die eventually
[2:36:00] <+mike_wuz_here> we'll all die eventually
[2:36:05] <munzevid> Nice reaction
[2:36:14] <Honkerbeeper> PUBG is really nothing new to though
[2:36:22] <Honkerbeeper> its just another battle Royale game
[2:36:24] <elcazadorriley > Unfortunately, streamers have a lot of influence
[2:36:33] <Honkerbeeper> it doesnt bring anything new to the table
[2:36:33] <+Yamr3> @ThomasBlomkal Of course but player retention keeps things going for years with competitive community.
[2:36:36] <elcazadorriley > They decide if a game gets attention or not

[2:37:05] <+Yamr3> @Captjack2000, Nice that a tournament can happen but isn't the map RNG created?
[2:37:06] <jinglos> people will get tired of pubg and move on to the next reddit hype, until it dies all over again. rinse and repeat don't tell me it's not true
[2:37:10] <ThomasBlomkal> Im pretty sure PUbg will be an esport for couple of years once they deal with all the stuff that takes teh game down
[2:37:24] <Honkerbeeper> MP9s
[2:37:24] <ThomasBlomkal> pubg is not reddit hype, wtf is this kid on about
[2:37:29] <+Yamr3> If so, how can you take that game competitively in a serious matter when it's RNG?
[2:37:42] <ThomasBlomkal> how is it rng?
[2:37:44] <Honkerbeeper> anyone care to explain why they would buy MP9s
[2:37:46] <elcazadorriley > PUBG is all RNG, why do people love it so much
[2:38:04] <ThomasBlomkal> how is it rng? u have the same chance as anybody else
[2:38:11] <Honkerbeeper> it's all camping not really RNG
[2:38:20] <roman_grace> PRIVET NAROOOOD
[2:38:22] <+Yamr3> I don't know, I'm asking if it is. I refuse to play or buy it. Saw gameplay and not interested in it. More boring than watching Crossfire
[2:38:24] <DarthScrub79> Watching for 10mins and then realizing it's a rerun wtf
[2:38:24] <elcazadorriley > It is though, you can win just off the circle alone
[2:38:33] <+N1K0CSGO> @Honkerbeeper mp9s have fast fire rate, and good close range substitute for UMPs
[2:38:36] <budly10> @honkerbeeper higher kill reward then a normal rifle, and seeing that the other team it is a pretty safe buy
[2:38:39] <+meltingupwards> thats legit the definition of rng..
[2:39:11] <ThomasBlomkal> im not gonna play PUBG as well, but hating and saying its RNG is stupid
[2:39:11] <elcazadorriley > The map is purely RNG lol what are you talking about? Teams win solely off the shrink being in their favor
[2:39:26] <elcazadorriley > I have 400 hours in it, the game is RNG
[2:39:34] <+Yamr3> Do all the players have a fair chance at looting? As far as I know, where you land is random. Not very fair
[2:39:45] <ffkjoao> !schedule
[2:39:45] <ThomasBlomkal> elcaza its called tactic, just like in csgo, u need to count on every shrink and andjust your approach to it
[2:39:50] <exuvium> thats why fortnite is a better esport
[2:39:50] <jinglos> pubg is complete garbage the numbers don't mean anything, anyone playing it is forcing it so hard
[2:39:55] <+N1K0CSGO> guys guys
[2:40:05] <ThomasBlomkal> jinglos u so mad kid lol
[2:40:06] <+meltingupwards> everything is luck and rng in the end
[2:40:09] <jinglos> people are forcing themselves to like this garbage
[2:40:09] <elcazadorriley > @ThomasBlomkal I know how to play, Im saying its undeniable that its RNG, youre wrong to say it isnt
[2:40:09] <+N1K0CSGO> point is, battle royale games all suck, they copy each other but in the end the shit is never fair and never will be
[2:40:17] <jinglos> @ThomasBlomkal says u
[2:40:19] <+I1q4> "forcing it so hard" lolll
[2:40:27] <+meltingupwards> skill can improve your odds
[2:40:28] <Honkerbeeper> BUY NEGEVS!!
[2:40:35] <clive_irish> plane is random, spawns are random, circle is random, airdrops are random
[2:40:46] <roman_grace> FUCK
[2:40:50] <ThomasBlomkal> @elcazadorriley\s 2500 hrs in arma 3 BR, 3000 hrs in h1z1, please dont tell me I donno what im talking about
[2:40:51] <Flax1s> who won
[2:40:56] <roman_grace> FUKC
[2:40:59] <+Yamr3> @Hellichopta, That doesn't sound right from the gameplay I've seen of it.
[2:41:00] <+N1K0CSGO> renegades
[2:41:05] <roman_grace> FAK
[2:41:09] <ThomasBlomkal> it looks like rng for new players, but its absolutely not
[2:41:28] <+N1K0CSGO> bro battle royale sucks
[2:41:32] <ThomasBlomkal> @exuvium im living normal life bruh
[2:41:39] <Honkerbeeper> is there any professional gameplay of the Negev being used now that it's $2000?
[2:41:41] <scippa> !schedule
[2:41:46] <+N1K0CSGO> always will suck, especially pubg, pubg is so poorly optimized for average computers

[2:41:54] <elcazadorriley > Thomas you actually dont? you literally cant say it isnt RNG the game has RNG
[2:42:02] <elcazadorriley > Youre being an idiot
[2:42:05] <scippa> sda
[2:42:06] <clive_irish> lol how is it not random, you just said you adjust to what the game gives you, that means you adjust to the random elements the game gives you
[2:42:10] <scippa> !schedule
[2:42:30] <scippa> !bracket
[2:42:50] <Captjack2000> the game is RNG, but in a way in which it isnt hard to adjust to, compared to other RNG games.
[2:42:54] <ThomasBlomkal> @elcazadorriley\s sure cuz only your opinion is the right one. Jebaited its not rng for any player with IQ higher than 15
[2:43:09] <elcazadorriley > PUBG being RNG is not an opinion????????????????????????????
[2:43:14] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal do you know what RNG is
[2:43:34] <ThomasBlomkal> by your logic any game is rng
[2:43:43] <roman_grace> OMG
[2:43:52] <Dabears2244> anyone know what keyboards they are using >
[2:43:53] <+Yamr3> @exuvium But in CSGO each gun has a specific firing pattern that doesn't change. Making it fair.
[2:43:57] <elcazadorriley > Youre a total idiot, why am I talking to you
[2:44:02] <roman_grace> SWITCH
[2:44:09] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal RNG means literally "random number generation" which means loot is random, spawns are random, there is no way to predict exactly what you will get 100%
[2:44:09] <+yabuoy> NIFTY
[2:44:11] <ThomasBlomkal> please explain to me how different is "rng" in pubg compared to tomb raider for example
[2:44:20] <+Yamr3> Clear difference in RNG and CSGO firing patterns.
[2:44:20] <Flax1s> NERD DRAMA Kappa
[2:44:23] <Scrimy_0> most games have rng just that better players know how to negate the effects of rng
[2:44:37] <ThomasBlomkal> @Captjack2000 thats true, but you can apply rng rule to basically any situation in any game
[2:44:40] <elcazadorriley > Does anyone know what Thomas is talking about? He literally said you can make PUBG non RNG
[2:44:44] <clive_irish> tomb raider esport ready?
[2:44:47] <Dabears2244> anyone know the keyboards ?
[2:44:53] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal Tomb Raider has a linear story, meaning that the game will progress the exact same way no matter what you do
[2:44:56] <elcazadorriley > The only RNG in a game should be player skill
[2:45:14] <PauloAcatoba> Why the f did my message get deleted
[2:45:14] <@Moobot> DreamHack Store: http://store.dreamhack.com/?utm_source=twitch_CS&utm_campaign=twitch_panel&utm_medium=twitch
[2:45:15] <elcazadorriley > a competitive one
[2:45:24] <+Yamr3> Bears I think they're using Corsairs
[2:45:40] <ThomasBlomkal> @Captjack2000 yeah but the enemies will not be standing on one same spot, so its RNG as well in different way than pubg
[2:45:40] <+Yamr3> Doesn't look like the Logitech G910
[2:45:49] <exuvium> @Yamr3 that argument only applies to spray. it does not address jumpshots or noscopes
[2:46:02] <elcazadorriley > TOMB RAIDER ISNT A COMPETITIVE SHOOTER JESUS DUDE
[2:46:07] <exuvium> and your point is moot anyway cuz im agreeing with you. games can have rng and still be good competitive games
[2:46:14] <elcazadorriley > WHAT EVEN IS YOUR POINT
[2:46:14] <c0lton0> every pro has their sponsors keyboard the only thing they are forced to use is the headphones
[2:46:14] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal yeah, but the situation with pubg is that it has more RNG elements, that will ultimately determine the fate of many players
[2:46:51] <+Hellichopta> The argument here is basically how much RNG you're ok with in your games, if PUBG is too much for you that's fine
[2:47:25] <exuvium> @Captjack2000 yes but more rng layers allows for less eccentric rng spreads allowing the game to operate on a more consistent average
[2:47:31] <ThomasBlomkal> yeah and thats the thing, RNG elements are in every single game, its just some game has more some less, but opinion that "PUBG is only RNG" is just stupid and childish
[2:47:40] <+ChaosVVxrm> doesnt rng stand for random number generator?
[2:47:49] <clive_irish> you just said pubg isn't rng
[2:48:01] <ThomasBlomkal> *isnt all
[2:48:03] <+ChaosVVxrm> im trying to be relevant, @ me if its working
[2:48:05] <elcazadorriley > its not an opinion, its a fact PUBG has RNG
[2:48:06] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal in tomb raider you wont spawn next to an enemy and get shotgunned in the head and instantly die
[2:48:13] <exuvium> its also used as a verb, ie: random number generation used to refer to randomness in a game @aPGs_Bape_Shirt
[2:48:29] <+ChaosVVxrm> ty, i was worried it wouldnt work
[2:48:31] <ThomasBlomkal> you dont spawn in PUBG, u are teh master of your destiny
[2:48:33] <GhostMeister> Pubg has rng 100%
[2:48:43] <GhostMeister> finding loot, finding a car when your out of zone
[2:48:51] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal the plane spawn and path is rng
[2:48:58] <GhostMeister> ^
[2:48:59] <ThomasBlomkal> @elcazadorriley\s haha now you changing your attitude to dont look stupid, love it rofl
[2:49:01] <+Hellichopta> Yeah pubg absolutely has RNG, managing RNG is a skill tho like in pro hearthstone
[2:49:05] <+ChaosVVxrm> uhm u can choose where to camp in pubg. how isthat rng?
[2:49:06] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal whether someone goes to the same place as you is rng
[2:49:11] <Scrimy_0> such a pointless argument about rng, if you die a lot in pubg from rng it's not the fault of there being too much rng it just means you're bad
[2:49:16] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal whether someone gets into the house with the gun is rng
[2:49:17] <GhostMeister> @Hellichopta I agree
[2:49:26] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal whether there is a gun in your house is RNg
[2:49:28] <roman_grace> I AM RUSSIA
[2:49:34] <ThomasBlomkal> @Captjack2000 thats not rng, you are able to check around you and adjust the tactics to it
[2:49:36] <GhostMeister> I AM RUSKI
[2:49:36] <roman_grace> HELLO
[2:49:44] <GhostMeister> HENLO
[2:49:44] <+Yamr3> @ThomasBlomkal Nothing is consistent though. It's all randomly created without a controlled pattern
[2:49:47] <roman_grace> PIZDISH
[2:49:50] <exuvium> @Captjack2000 technically player patterns arent rng. depends if you believe in determinism though
[2:50:06] <+FilthyKeyboard> PogChamp
[2:50:08] <roman_grace> TI NE RUSSKI
[2:50:09] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal do you agree that if you go to the same house in two different games, there will be different loot?
[2:50:15] <+ChaosVVxrm> fact is god controls everything. jesus saves!
[2:50:23] <ThomasBlomkal> @Captjack2000 yes loot is rng, thats the only thing i consider to be rng alongside with circle shrinks and crate drops
[2:50:27] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal That is RNG, and that is my point
[2:50:33] <exuvium> @Captjack2000 heres an example for you, a computer gives you a number between 1-5 and you need to add a number to it to add up to 6
[2:50:43] <roman_grace> MEN YOU ITS NOT RUSSIA
[2:50:44] <exuvium> technically the number you get is rng, but you can always make it add up to 6
[2:50:47] <ThomasBlomkal> I NEVER SAID THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO RNG IN PUBG
[2:50:53] <exuvium> is that game rng or not
[2:50:58] <ThomasBlomkal> I SAID THAT PUBG IS NOT ALL RNG
[2:51:09] <ThomasBlomkal> see the difference?
[2:51:09] <Captjack2000> @exuvium you are right about the non-AI players not being RNG, sorry
[2:51:12] <+Yamr3> It's built on and around RNG
[2:51:28] <+ChaosVVxrm> are fog maos rng?
[2:51:29] <trickyhero> NA CS EleGiggle
[2:51:33] <+ChaosVVxrm> maps*
[2:51:35] <roman_grace> RUSSKIE ESTI?
[2:51:36] <exuvium> but the outcome of the game is strictly deterministic, assuming the user knows how to add
[2:51:37] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal here is the segment when I provide quotes from you
[2:51:41] <elcazadorriley > YOU DID THOUGH YOU IDIOT
[2:51:43] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal "how is it rng? u have the same chance as anybody else"
[2:51:48] <+ChaosVVxrm> i dont think the fog maps in pubg are rng
[2:52:15] <Captjack2000> @ThomasBlomkal " im not gonna play PUBG as well, but hating and saying its RNG is stupi"
[2:52:19] <ThomasBlomkal> @Captjack2000 read the whole segment and what i was reacting to, dont cut sth out of context
[2:52:39] <Captjack2000> Its not out of context at all

[2:53:06] <Liangjw> nymnCorn
[2:53:08] <ThomasBlomkal> it is the starting sentence to this debate was an opinion, that "pubg is all about rng"
[2:53:11] <+ChaosVVxrm> at the flag pole
[2:53:30] <Liangjw> which it is
[2:53:41] <ThomasBlomkal> its not all about rng. period.
[2:53:49] <roman_grace> PIDARY
[2:53:49] <elcazadorriley > He said so guys
[2:54:03] <ThomasBlomkal> @Captjack2000 wrong

[2:54:40] <Themmification> Just stfu jack
[2:54:43] <ThomasBlomkal> " I am defending the point that RNG determines whether or not you will live" this is a text book example of being wrong
[2:54:49] <Scrimy_0> @ThomasBlomkal pubg is all about rng it's just how well you can play around it
[2:54:54] <Themmification> Dont say anything cus you're wrong
[2:55:02] <exuvium> you guys just dont understand the difference between rng determining the outcome of a game, and a player not allowing rng to determine the outcome of a game
[2:55:06] <Liangjw> AZR GOD PogChamp
[2:55:14] <ThomasBlomkal> i dont like pubg, im just not a hateboy
[2:55:24] <Themmification> Jh
[2:55:30] <ThomasBlomkal> read exuvium
[2:55:32] <tanebb> godzr
[2:55:39] <elcazadorriley > @exuvium that wasnt his argument though, we are talking about him saying it has no RNG
[2:55:45] <ThomasBlomkal> once u turn 15 and u will learn how to use logic, u will get it
[2:56:14] <exuvium> @elcazadorriley i think he poorly phrased his initial point. he acknowledges rng but is arguing against the people who think rng alone will make you win
[2:56:14] <ThomasBlomkal> @elcazadorriley\s yeah keep lying to protect your bullshit opinion that has been ripped to ieced
[2:56:16] <Themmification> ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨
[2:56:20] <exuvium> which it can obviously, but not to the degree you guys claim
[2:56:35] <ThomasBlomkal> @Captjack2000 not the point
[2:56:49] <elcazadorriley > @ThomasBlomkal but it isnt an opinion, youre so stupid.
[2:57:00] <Liangjw> why is this discussion taking place here
[2:57:07] <Liangjw> isn't there a PUBG stream where u can banter
[2:57:16] <ThomasBlomkal> @elcazadorriley\s if i were ou i would be ashamed of showing my stupidity online rofl
[2:57:18] <exuvium> im not sure dude, prob cuz pubg has more players than csgo
[2:57:43] <CS_Char> guys thats his opinion it doesnt matter if its wrong or right its what he believes, you guys have your won opinions
[2:57:55] <CS_Char> own* XD
[2:58:01] <+Yamr3> the hell?
[2:58:09] <Liangjw> why don't yall agree to disagree like that guy said
[2:58:13] <ThomasBlomkal> exactly u wanna have your opinions? good have them, just dont serve them to me as the only true
[2:58:18] <CS_Char> also SFSU ITS CSGO NOT PUBG
[2:58:23] <Liangjw> world peace can be achieved this way
[2:58:30] <+Yamr3> I mean, I'm not going to agree to disagree on this. The dude is clearly not seeing the light
[2:58:36] <elcazadorriley > THEY ARENT OPINIONS???????????????????????????????????
[2:58:40] <elcazadorriley > PUBG IS FACTUALLY RNG
[2:58:42] <exuvium> fortnite is better than pubg anyway TriHard
[2:58:44] <CS_Char> guys stfu already
[2:58:47] <ThomasBlomkal> eclaza so mad kiddo lol
[2:58:59] <ThomasBlomkal> he need to argue a lot on internet, thats so sad
[2:59:06] <CS_Char> @exuvium leave now
[2:59:07] <ThomasBlomkal> BabyRage
[2:59:20] <ThomasBlomkal> hes true tho LUL
[2:59:28] <+Yamr3> It's built on RNG and obvisouly gives a advantage over to others by chance that's not controlled by players.
[2:59:36] <Liangjw> I mean I think PUBG is all abt RNG but I won't care if someone else doesn't think so
[2:59:46] <+Yamr3> Nothing is consistent in the game besides player movement and tactics.

[3:12:04] <ThomasBlomkal> your logic may be?
[3:12:13] <+Jax1492> counter
[3:12:15] <Captjack2000> you are saying that the others in the chat are stupid and you are the smartest person here
[3:12:38] <ThomasBlomkal> i didnt say that
[3:12:45] <ThomasBlomkal> you are stupid
[3:12:49] <exuvium> its entirely possible that the stupidity he's referring to is strictly his own, which would make your statement untrue
[3:12:56] <+Yamr3> FailFish
[3:12:59] <Captjack2000> why are you even here instead of somewhere on the internet like the neuroscience forums or the astrophysics fan club?

[3:13:00] <exuvium> and therefore both of you would be stupid
[3:13:07] <exuvium> leaving me, once again, to be the smartest in chat. which i am

[5:25:22] <+DriverBen> people still play it, therefore it's not dead
[5:25:31] <+DriverBen> LOTS of people for that matter
[5:27:43] <+cpt_owl> The general public still plays it but the pro scene is definitely oversaturated, hence people not watching vago that much nowadays
[5:28:04] <+cpt_owl> *csgo
[5:28:12] <+DriverBen> Part of the problem is they always play the same maps
[5:28:16] <Sandsolo123> School hours in europe atm...
[5:28:25] <+DriverBen> Since 1.8, people STILL play pro on Dust 2 FFS

[10:23:39] <natekvr> whats this casters accent?
[10:24:01] <+DriverBen> I think he said he's Scottish
[10:24:36] <natekvr> yeah kinda sounds like it
[10:24:41] <natekvr> but sounds mixed
[10:24:47] <+roneryasian> It's actually Haitian
[10:25:17] <+DriverBen> I just know he said during a match "Ooh my Scottish accent!" while they were talking about something random
[10:25:35] <+roneryasian> He's 100% not scottish
[10:25:40] <+DriverBen> Unless it's a new caster
[10:26:00] <+roneryasian> also i was trolling about him being haitian
[10:26:04] <+DriverBen> When I heard one of them say it, it was like 2.5-3hrs ago
[10:26:09] <+DriverBen> Lol
[10:26:45] <+roneryasian> sounds like european, but heavily americanised
[10:27:03] <+DriverBen> It's in Denver, so I wouldn't be surprised if he was raised in the US
[10:27:10] <+DriverBen> getting local casters
[10:27:37] <+roneryasian> They're both american apparently
[10:27:55] <+roneryasian> but his last name is Stromberg
[10:27:59] <+DriverBen> I'm not surprised.

[22:40:25] <sargon1> N0thing and shroud no longer play...so I want them to lose
[22:40:28] <thesherab> lol why? because your boy's Shroud and n0thing left
[22:40:33] <thesherab> Oh I perdicted it
[22:40:34] <sargon1> yes
[22:40:45] <+keagan14> why did they leave tho
[22:40:53] <thesherab> n0thing was kicked
[22:41:01] <+keagan14> how comeeee
[22:41:01] <thesherab> Shroud wanted to be a full time streamer
[22:41:19] <+keagan14> how come he was kicked tho
[22:41:32] <thesherab> Not sure, guess they didn't think he was performing
[22:41:36] <Kinxfire> no one was kicked
[22:41:54] <thesherab> He's still afilliated with the team yes
[22:41:56] <hi_im_nilton> he's benched. its a kind way to say you're kicked when your contract runs out
[22:41:56] <Kinxfire> it was a decision of them
[22:42:05] <thesherab> But he was kicked from the lineup
[22:42:13] <thesherab> and won't be returning
[22:42:21] <Kinxfire> yea, the line up... not team
[22:42:26] <+JT_ThatGamingGuy> shroud is still signed by c9
[22:42:32] <+JT_ThatGamingGuy> noodle
[22:42:39] <+piLgrumify> #politicks
[22:42:56] <+piLgrumify> #spelling
[22:43:08] <sargon1> why kick nothing though...tell me how hes not a good playeR?
[22:43:16] <Kinxfire> 2 weeks after he left... the called him to play instead of swag
[22:43:35] <Kinxfire> they*
[22:43:40] <thesherab> Yeah, but now it's been to long
[22:44:02] <+JT_ThatGamingGuy> shroud is laffing anyway.. since he left hes made loads of money off donations and subs
[22:44:12] <Kinxfire> hopehuly he's gonna return
[22:44:14] <sargon1> yeah
[22:44:23] <ChinesaApertada> n0thing has a disgusting voice thats why he got kicked LUL
[22:44:23] <thesherab> He won't return
[22:44:23] <+JT_ThatGamingGuy> no he wont return
[22:44:29] <+piLgrumify> Progamer to streamer is not at all a bad career move
[22:44:37] <thesherab> He's given up on CS from what I can tell
[22:44:38] <SlipVFX> he has 44k ppl watching him right now... I dont think he is coming back lol
[22:44:41] <+JT_ThatGamingGuy> hes cleary said he will never play in pro L ever again
[22:44:41] <Kinxfire> let me have my dreams dude
[22:44:42] <+piLgrumify> Basically puts you ahead of all the other streamers
[22:44:56] <thesherab> It would be one thing if he still streamed CS
[22:45:03] <thesherab> but he doesn't
[22:45:04] <+piLgrumify> Only way to make it in streaming is to be a pro, be entertaining
[22:45:28] <+JT_ThatGamingGuy> he played CS that much he just got bored
[22:45:28] <+bj_may> I dont even play counter strike but these big esport matches are so exciting to watch
[22:45:31] <thesherab> People either watch you because you funny, or because you're good at the game

[1 day, 11:14:52] <Outsiiderr7> i dont see the point in faking site pushes in cobble because rotations are so fast and connector is such a major place to sit and play from
[1 day, 11:14:54] <Mertbal12> sa
[1 day, 11:16:38] <Outsiiderr7> faking on siets like dust 2 would be a lot more viable because it takes a lot more tim to rotate
[1 day, 11:16:50] <gedxx> well it worked
[1 day, 11:16:59] <gedxx> they had full control of site
[1 day, 11:17:27] <Outsiiderr7> ik it did but that is because fnatic made the mistake of over rotating
[1 day, 11:17:36] <gedxx> its always viable
[1 day, 11:18:02] <Outsiiderr7> if they kept 1 person on a envy would have lost the round
[1 day, 11:18:26] <gedxx> you cant say that
[1 day, 11:18:41] <gedxx> couldve went any way
[1 day, 11:19:15] <gedxx> fact is envy outplayed them forcing them to rotate
[1 day, 11:19:33] <gedxx> no mistakes were made
[1 day, 11:19:42] <Outsiiderr7> from envy
[1 day, 11:20:06] <gedxx> say they didnt fake and fully commited and someone from fnatic stayed
[1 day, 11:21:09] <gedxx> what am saying is no mistakes were made
