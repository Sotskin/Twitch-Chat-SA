[21:11:44] <MrTucoSalamanca> NEO WTFF
[21:13:43] <wellhyper> Honestly, VP getting rekt yet again why dont they just RETIRE ?
[21:14:15] <MrTucoSalamanca> they are still a good team
[21:14:22] <wellhyper> almost as bad as NIP but atleast NIP made roster changes, VP are clowns FailFish
[21:14:32] <MrTucoSalamanca> they need some new players
[21:14:45] <wellhyper> yeah 5
[21:15:10] <MrTucoSalamanca> LUL
[21:15:29] <wellhyper> better call saul was alright wasnt it
[21:15:36] <MrTucoSalamanca> wp is not a conctant team but when they play good they can
[21:15:44] <wellhyper> not exctly breaking bad but not too shabby
[21:16:35] <MrTucoSalamanca> yeah ı agree
[21:17:01] <wellhyper> players should not be paid unless they win games
[21:17:19] <wellhyper> cos VP are just milking the monthly cheque
[21:17:35] <MrTucoSalamanca> last year they were not bad they win with comback lots of matches
[21:17:55] <wellhyper> but yeah if breaking bad was half life 2 then half life 3 would be better call saul

[1 day, 19:39:44] <vodzzz> ;)
[1 day, 19:40:04] <vodzzz> so hard to read titles
[1 day, 19:45:31] <VinnyPimba> rip immortals
[1 day, 19:47:24] <Lindgrennnnn> GG boiiiissss
[1 day, 19:53:45] <BlackoutPRPRO> Guys which is better m4a4 or m4a1s
[1 day, 19:54:35] <Thelimpan> depends what you want to do
[1 day, 19:54:42] <BrOsBiT> m4, but 1s is easier To spray
[1 day, 19:54:58] <BlackoutPRPRO> I want to be lil aggressive
[1 day, 19:55:33] <BrOsBiT> m4 For the for sure
[1 day, 19:56:09] <BrOsBiT> m4 for sure then i mean
[1 day, 19:56:24] <Thelimpan> having 20 bullets isnt the best option for aggressive plays though
[1 day, 19:56:34] <BlackoutPRPRO> bro what you use
[1 day, 19:56:58] <BrOsBiT> m4a4
[1 day, 19:57:21] <Thelimpan> i switch alot, often silencer when i hide on sites
[1 day, 19:57:37] <BrOsBiT> I switch asee
[1 day, 19:57:43] <Thelimpan> without when pushing or peeking
[1 day, 19:57:49] <BlackoutPRPRO> thanks man, I was trying to use m4a1s but it was too underpower 4 me
[1 day, 19:58:18] <Thelimpan> its alot more accurate however
[1 day, 19:58:29] <BlackoutPRPRO> true
[1 day, 19:58:39] <BrOsBiT> 1s is so easy to spray tho. sorry For spelling, on Phone atm, lol
[1 day, 19:58:39] <Thelimpan> but hard to stop a 5 man push with it
[1 day, 19:58:50] <BlackoutPRPRO> and its spray is simple
[1 day, 19:59:35] <BlackoutPRPRO> ak is too overpowered compared to any weapon
[1 day, 19:59:49] <BrOsBiT> not really
[1 day, 20:00:16] <Tapoutrusher> m4 just beat an ak in a 1v1
[1 day, 20:00:27] <Tapoutrusher> Explain that
[1 day, 20:00:29] <Thelimpan> the 1shot is an advantage, but you can't always score headshots
[1 day, 20:00:34] <BrOsBiT> ssg is 1 shot For head too, but costs more
[1 day, 20:00:52] <BlackoutPRPRO> if you know to use ak it's recommended to every pro
[1 day, 20:01:23] <BrOsBiT> I always pick up ak if possible over m4
[1 day, 20:01:32] <BlackoutPRPRO> me too
[1 day, 20:02:05] <BlackoutPRPRO> and glock is still broken
[1 day, 20:02:17] <BrOsBiT> and spray pattern isnt that Hard after a while
[1 day, 20:03:18] <BrOsBiT> pistols are broken.. cz is ridiculous
[1 day, 20:03:44] <Thelimpan> cz is hard to use
[1 day, 20:04:04] <BlackoutPRPRO> lol cz is a God you can stop rush
[1 day, 20:04:11] <BrOsBiT> not in close combat
[1 day, 20:04:21] <BlackoutPRPRO> learn cz pattern
[1 day, 20:04:42] <BlackoutPRPRO> inaccuracy is a problem tho
[1 day, 20:05:18] <Thelimpan> however, with tec9 being crap now, cz might be a better option
[1 day, 20:05:32] <BrOsBiT> but they need To nerf it.. i want To see More deagles again
[1 day, 20:05:43] <BlackoutPRPRO> before 2014 cz was more powerful and can be switched fast
[1 day, 20:08:25] <BrOsBiT> inb4 they make cz so it has More Bullets and less recoil Kappa
[1 day, 20:08:53] <BlackoutPRPRO> LUL

[1 day, 20:22:32] <BlackoutPRPRO> 1 more question, how to short brust in long range, croch one not working it's only mid - short
[1 day, 20:22:32] <@Moobot> DreamHack Store: http://store.dreamhack.com/?utm_source=twitch_CS&utm_campaign=twitch_panel&utm_medium=twitch
[1 day, 20:26:42] <BrOsBiT> 3 Bullet bursts for long range
[1 day, 20:27:09] <BrOsBiT> but it depends
[1 day, 20:27:43] <BlackoutPRPRO> like pit to A
[1 day, 20:28:12] <BrOsBiT> just tap, dont spray
[1 day, 20:28:52] <BlackoutPRPRO> yeah I do the same, but I get awped LUL
[1 day, 20:29:47] <BrOsBiT> thats why you need smokes and flashbangs, or hope that awp is bad LUL
[1 day, 20:31:07] <BrOsBiT> its always bad situation if u are In pit and awp on a and he knows your location
[1 day, 20:31:33] <ihuarraqax> agree
[1 day, 20:31:52] <BrOsBiT> if you dont have nades
[1 day, 20:36:25] <BrOsBiT> or you can bait shot and escape SeemsGood
