[6:53:04] <xarmanis15ii> its not possible
[6:53:38] <Cassy39> well i mean it is possible but they might just get busted
[6:53:49] <TheRadioVoiceGuy> IS IT LIVE?
[6:53:50] <spoonsforlife> they will definetley get busted
[6:53:55] <xarmanis15ii> idk man
[6:54:03] <Cassy39> like hide blue tooth ear phones under the headset he has on
[6:54:14] <spoonsforlife> not possible theyre checked
[6:54:54] <Cassy39> hide it in a balloon up their b u t t
[6:55:07] <+plygrndflash> and there is a guy in the back who check this
[6:55:36] <jackeboi_> lol
[6:55:44] <Cassy39> haha they dont even do that in airports half the time, they're not gonna do a rectal examine for csogo
[6:56:06] <spoonsforlife> everycplayers and coaches equipments are checked
[6:56:23] <jackeboi_> im silver 1.
[6:56:30] <Cassy39> yeah but not inside their butt
[6:56:40] <overoverovera> why so few viewers?
[6:56:47] <spoonsforlife> how will u get it outta there
[6:57:22] <Cassy39> it'll be inside a balloon so just pull it out
[6:57:31] <spoonsforlife> how?
[6:57:44] <Cassy39> by using finger and thumb
[6:57:49] <+plygrndflash> @overoverovera its a rerun
[6:58:04] <spoonsforlife> and how will u put it on undetected?
[6:58:08] <Cassy39> thats how people illegally import drugs
[6:58:23] <Cassy39> what do you mean
[6:58:36] <spoonsforlife> how will the coach put it on undetected?
[6:58:37] <overoverovera> @plygrndflash ty
[6:59:19] <Cassy39> put it on the inside of his headphones
[6:59:58] <Cassy39> use the iphone bluetooth ear phones, he can just answer a call through his phone
[7:00:08] <Cassy39> they dont watch them all the time
[7:00:48] <Cassy39> just knock the observer out and hide his body in a duffel bag
[7:00:58] <+plygrndflash> xD
[7:01:05] <Cassy39> easy win
[7:01:25] <Cassy39> not if you completed the club penguin judo
[7:01:36] <randomnewbbs> why would they want to cheat tho
[7:01:47] <Cassy39> to win money
[7:02:14] <Cassy39> tell the observer his shoe is untied and when he crouches down you snap
[7:02:28] <randomnewbbs> cheat = risk getting caught
[7:02:40] <Cassy39> and break his rib-cage
[7:03:01] <Cassy39> then crouch down to tie yours and untie his
[7:03:15] <Cassy39> or say hes got gum on his feet
[7:03:43] <Cassy39> well i cheated for a week without getting vac'd
[7:03:48] <+plygrndflash> its the best logic i ever heard
[7:04:00] <trekspt> CASTON VAC
