[12:10:53] <kardyle> JA VAI?
[12:11:19] <fasadafasada> I think G2 will win
[12:11:28] <detrify> do the need to capture both A and B to win or what?
[12:11:42] <Edinthebadbhopper> yes
[12:11:43] <brutalsage> is this life ?
[12:11:43] <kardyle> lucas
[12:11:53] <j3lter> Meu pênis é grande
[12:12:02] <kardyle> 4k digno
[12:12:07] <fasadafasada> you need to control both control points to win golden coins
[12:12:08] <hillerkiller234> Gues i need one more csgo friend for a five men group so we need pepole who is gn2+
[12:12:12] <j3lter> Jogo cs em 40 fps
[12:12:21] <kardyle> foda-se
[12:12:35] <toxikshade> yes but you can trade the golden coins for the platinum coins
[12:12:38] <Edinthebadbhopper> im global hiller
[12:12:52] <toxikshade> then you can capture zone C
[12:12:59] <hillerkiller234> if someone wants to join my team tell me cuz you will win 90% win and 10% to lose
[12:13:15] <fasadafasada> ofcourse you can, but we wont know who gets the coins until we see who wins
[12:13:17] <DproEdwards> why do some people use regular m4 and some use m4s. is there really a difference
[12:13:17] <detrify> what are g2 going? immortals are first on the scene every time. seems like they have a shorter distance
[12:13:30] <DproEdwards> hillerkiller i just started like 5 days ago
[12:13:39] <toxikshade> yeah but if you use the master stone you dont need to win at all
[12:13:51] <hillerkiller234> @DproEdwards: m4a1-s no spray m4a4 there is spray
[12:13:54] <toxikshade> unless they have a dark crystal
[12:13:55] <+Kenny117012> @DproEdwards M4 is 30 bullet clip M4a1s is 20 round clip
[12:14:04] <detrify> makes sense
[12:14:04] <hillerkiller234> boddy wins these
[12:14:07] <toxikshade> i usually play the wizard class
[12:14:17] <detrify> kewl

[12:14:22] <DproEdwards> ah ok thank you guys. i just picked the m4a1-s
[12:14:24] <w00tles> It is situational and also up to personal preference
[12:14:29] <kardyle> VAC
[12:14:30] <hillerkiller234> told you boddy wins these
[12:14:35] <Edinthebadbhopper> @hillerkiller234 the m4a1 has the easiest spray pattern known to man lol. its actually more for spraying than you think
[12:14:36] <yuricazzeri> KRL
[12:14:39] <Flaremage> M4A4 has more bullets and you can spray with it more ppl, its good againts rushes and you can even spray to the smoke and keep about 15 bullets for pushes
[12:14:45] <itzGeez> Who won
[12:14:53] <j3lter> EU AMO KENNYS
[12:14:54] <Edinthebadbhopper> g2

[12:15:08] <Edinthebadbhopper> lolg2
[12:15:09] <hillerkiller234> @Edinthebadbhopper i use m4a4 cuz i love it little bit more XD
[12:15:13] <toxikshade> g2
[12:15:16] <fasadafasada> @itzGeez I wish I knew that !
[12:15:17] <swoonmc> queota style
[12:15:20] <itzGeez> Alright thanks dude
[12:15:25] <hillerkiller234> gues new pro team lolg2
[12:15:26] <DproEdwards> i might have to try out regular m4 lol
[12:15:29] <toxikshade> love me
[12:15:35] <yuricazzeri> cloud9 x sk quando q é?
[12:15:38] <DproEdwards> im nervous to start playing comp. i know im going to get hate
[12:15:39] <+SquattBomb> youre all silvers it doesnt matter with m4 u use
[12:15:41] <swoonmc> a1 and a4 completely different, depends on your position you play on playing ct
[12:15:50] <itzGeez> M4a1 or m4a4 in your opinion
[12:15:51] <Edinthebadbhopper> ^^^idiot
[12:15:54] <swoonmc> plan on playinbg
[12:16:03] <j3lter> "Hello, I am an african-american"
[12:16:09] <Edinthebadbhopper> i use a4 because its easier to hold rushes with
[12:16:10] <toxikshade> how do i "get gud"
[12:16:11] <swoonmc> long angles are the best for a1
[12:16:20] <hillerkiller234> @Edinthebadbhopper ikr
[12:16:23] <Edinthebadbhopper> not reall
[12:16:24] <itzGeez> a1 keeps you off the radar
[12:16:25] <+Kenny117012> Practice
[12:16:36] <Flaremage> @SquattBomb said MM player Kappa
[12:16:46] <Edinthebadbhopper> theyre both about as accurate as each other m4a1s is easier to spray with
[12:17:08] <toxikshade> yeah practice, but how do i learn actual strategies
[12:17:14] <itzGeez> Guys, should I crouch when spraying or does it make it easier for a headshot??
[12:17:18] <Edinthebadbhopper> playing
[12:17:34] <Flaremage> crouch when you need to fix your spray
[12:17:37] <Edinthebadbhopper> you shouldnt crouch it literally does nothing to your accuracy, it just makes it easier for them to hit you
[12:17:39] <DirtyDanWithThePlan> Lol
[12:17:39] <fasadafasada> @toxikshade just watch this live game and try to imitate winning team (Immortals)
[12:17:39] <j3lter> @itzgeez spray with crouch is good
[12:17:45] <Flaremage> like you start spraying little bit higher than he is so you crouch
[12:17:53] <j3lter> crouch let me get more acuraccy
[12:18:12] <Edinthebadbhopper> these guys are lying. crouching does nothing to your accuracy mid-spray
[12:18:26] <YourBoyChaseOG> Yes it does smh
[12:18:26] <DproEdwards> I didnt mean to start this back and forth
[12:18:30] <Edinthebadbhopper> it just makes you easier to hit. you never see high level players crouch unless its a 3man spraydown or so
[12:18:41] <hillerkiller234> when me and my friends play csgo we dont rush like rush b and we lose or we win we play with smokes and flashes and smart plays im entry fragger
[12:18:42] <Flaremage> its just for fixing spray, lol
[12:19:03] <MidgetSpinnerLP> f
[12:19:06] <swoonmc> -_-
[12:19:17] <MidgetSpinnerLP> !live
[12:19:35] <Aznsportruck> wow so sad
[12:19:52] <Flaremage> it can be also like some type of defense bcs "pro" players often aims on the HS and if you crouch you can dodge their bullets (even your hits makes their cross. move higher"
[12:19:57] <MaJiiC_> lmao

[12:23:36] <cobbel> @Sajiki haha, and here I was thinking he was just playing cool ;)

[13:43:15] <debrisJD> cmonBruh
[13:43:20] <Outsmarthin> or didmt leave the tab
[13:43:32] <Outsmarthin> close*
[13:43:35] <WinTheChu> so you want those who ask is it live?
[13:43:38] <cnutthegr8> there actually cheating that hand thing he has on his hand is bionics it gives him robot level reflexes with the download of a usb
[13:44:09] <aven0x> People still use browers to watch twitch?
[13:44:31] <Outsmarthin> what else
[13:44:33] <Ghosty_88> lol
[13:44:45] <firstaccevr> yeah because the twitch app is fucking garbage scam
[13:44:59] <Ghosty_88> comeback immortals?
[13:45:01] <hillerkiller234> G2 EZ WIN
[13:45:10] <hillerkiller234> nope
[13:45:12] <firstaccevr> youre an idiot if you use the twitch app
[13:45:24] <Pyro_red> is he crying?
[13:45:28] <Donky_27> yeah g2 win
[13:45:28] <Applegamerplays> g2 is better lOL
[13:45:31] <hillerkiller234> im on my pc you idiot
[13:45:33] <DagnuET> Of course browser. Adblock y'know. Anything smaller than a computer for using on daily basis is quite stupid. PC has way more control over the content I use

[13:46:04] <Outsmarthin> no idea
[13:46:09] <Fasacryst> why is the twitch app bad?
[13:46:19] <hillerkiller234> G2 EZ WIN
[13:46:24] <aven0x> If you spend alot of hours on twitch the app is way smoother than brower
[13:46:47] <debrisJD> how could it be smoother
[13:46:57] <debrisJD> you open the stream, and then watch the stream, why does that need to be smooth
[13:47:11] <Outsmarthin> if you watch twitch for hours from a phone you are waste of oxygen
[13:47:33] <hillerkiller234> @Outsmarthin you are kinda dumb
[13:47:49] <Ghosty_88> i smell comeback~?
[13:47:59] <DagnuET> @Fasacryst because it's an app. PC browsing is superior
[13:47:59] <Hamnisu> I think not

[13:48:27] <hillerkiller234> DONT WORRY G2 EZ EZ EZ WIN

[14:23:10] <GoofballGurt> Is he not on the team anymore though?
[14:23:21] <GoofballGurt> I haven't watched CS in forever
[14:24:22] <tteach_tv> no he retired
[14:24:29] <Swimmingboya> Do NA teams ever make it out to the semi's or finals at all or are they as dominant as back in 1.6? Not kept up with cs at all for a while now PunOko
[14:24:46] <wunobi> im better than shroud
[14:25:22] <Swimmingboya> lol that shawt PunOko
[14:25:22] <tteach_tv> shroud top 5 best players in the world

[14:25:49] <ichujun> shroud is that pro pubg player right? Kappa
[14:25:58] <Swimmingboya> C9 win! PunOko
[14:26:07] <+DrLoveBond> shroud is two faced Kappa
[14:26:27] <+DrLoveBond> shroud likes bone less wings, no one normal would say that Kappa
[14:26:42] <NickeleleWW> did shroud retire permanently?
[14:27:11] <+DrLoveBond> nah shroud will be pro in 2020 when csgo pros make millions
[14:27:36] <+DrLoveBond> but he wont make any money and fall off to drug addiction Kappa
[14:27:40] <+korrupt_cs> Yes he is that PLEBg player
[14:27:58] <+korrupt_cs> I wouldn't say pro because that game is not competitive. He just makes money streaming it
[14:28:15] <NickeleleWW> ig
[14:28:27] <NickeleleWW> ya he makes more bank by streaming
[14:28:53] <AlBusiness> shroud gone. making that good money
[14:29:09] <NinjasSkRt_sKrT> true
[14:29:17] <+DrLoveBond> i doubt shroud will make good money long term, he will fall off
[14:29:46] <+DrLoveBond> to me he isnt good at comitting to things, we shall see, this pubg is just the beginning
[14:29:52] <+korrupt_cs> People will eventually get sick of watching drop school 300 times a day
[14:29:58] <NinjasSkRt_sKrT> yeah theres only a certain time that he will be popular on twitch
[14:30:00] <czfebby> who win g2 vs immortals?
[14:30:03] <+korrupt_cs> watching HIM drop school*
[14:30:14] <+korrupt_cs> G2 won
[14:30:14] <AlBusiness> shroud 20k subs = $99k a month before tax? plus donations? lol
[14:30:20] <+DrLoveBond> hes starting to come off super whiny
[14:30:22] <czfebby> nice, ty
[14:30:44] <+korrupt_cs> and he still can
[14:31:06] <+korrupt_cs> and he still can't get a decent hair cut!! XD

[14:31:44] <hiddenlols_8> @AlBusiness why da fuck would shroud have 20k subs, are you crazy xD not even the biggest streamer lul
[14:31:45] <+DrLoveBond> yeah he has money but hes a slave to us, he wont make any unless he streams Kappa
[14:31:50] <tteach_tv> @johnwickery u know shrouds not trying to play pubg competitive right
[14:32:05] <AlBusiness> @hiddenlols_8 he annouced it
[14:32:13] <+DrLoveBond> yeah I know, but hes trying to stream 40 hours a week :P
[14:32:26] <hiddenlols_8> @AlBusiness thats not true lol
[14:32:31] <tteach_tv> which is ez
[14:32:35] <+korrupt_cs> @tteach_tv because PLEBG isn't competitive. The best players don't win. You could hide all game and get 2 kills and win
[14:32:48] <+korrupt_cs> too much RNG
[14:32:50] <hiddenlols_8> to have 20k subs he would have to have 50+ active viewers constantly +/- @AlBusiness
[14:32:58] <tteach_tv> its all rng
[14:33:01] <hiddenlols_8> @AlBusiness minimum
[14:33:04] <+DrLoveBond> if shroud did go pro, he would blow at LAN and complain like always
[14:33:15] <+DrLoveBond> shroud is typical NA complain all the time OpieOP
[14:33:18] <tteach_tv> pro?
[14:33:31] <hiddenlols_8> @AlBusiness and he doesnt even have 20k active viewers, constantly, how da fuck could he have 20k subs xDD

[14:34:06] <AlBusiness> @hiddenlols_8 why would i lie about that or make it up. i watch his stream
[14:34:07] <hiddenlols_8> @johnwickery are you a lunatic? or just stupid?xD

[15:49:51] <driftkingv2> and g2 won dreamhack?
[15:50:04] <aven0x> yeh
[15:50:07] <driftkingv2> lul
[15:50:11] <VaeVictisKDmJ> yep
[15:50:14] <glickcs> kenny mvp
[15:50:26] <aven0x> G2 vs North was Grand Final
[15:50:33] <driftkingv2> never expected that
[15:50:56] <driftkingv2> im vp fan soo
[15:51:08] <driftkingv2> xD
[15:51:15] <aven0x> If I remember correctly grand final was the most boring set of games imo. Kinda one sided
[15:51:23] <VaeVictisKDmJ> fnatic nip fan here
[15:52:45] <+mundayne1> voice crack
[15:52:48] <aven0x> draken looked promising at DH, that one flick on Overpass Kreygasm
[15:53:37] <wilieverbestopped> He was à god
[15:54:15] <aven0x> fitch from gambat was a beast as well for his first tourny. So many promising youngsters, we in for some good cs upcoming months
[15:54:34] <wilieverbestopped> If he gets more games like this And training at nip hes gonna be the best player in the world
[15:55:15] <aven0x> Who knows, maybe ^^
[15:55:41] <marcelopirescs> not maybe
[15:56:03] <marcelopirescs> of course he will be the best player in the world
[15:56:06] <Mt_West> IDK if y'all have already talked about it but FaZe is gonna be scary good once they play more together. So much talent on one team.
[15:56:40] <marcelopirescs> yea too much talent in one team
[15:57:14] <Mt_West> You thinking "Too many chiefs, not enough Indians" type thing?
[15:57:14] <Nesia_TV> karrigan is the problem in that team
[15:57:25] <Gutterm0uth> PogChamp
[15:57:57] <marcelopirescs> karrigan isnt the problem its the solution
[15:58:25] <hjallemar> karrigan is the only reason FaZe ever made it to be a top tier team
[15:58:30] <Mt_West> lol who would be the problem then? They will be good but can't win every match.
[15:58:38] <tejas_jack> karrigan suck
[15:59:04] <hjallemar> karrigan isnt a fragger
[15:59:12] <Nesia_TV> he played bad at dreamhack malmao though
[15:59:16] <hjallemar> he is an igl
[15:59:30] <hjallemar> he isnt supposed to be a star player
[15:59:47] <Mt_West> So in everyones opinion who is the weak link on that team?
[16:00:01] <darberxx> you
[16:00:12] <hjallemar> teams doesnt work like that, lol
[16:00:25] <Mt_West> :( :(
[16:00:27] <hjallemar> there isnt just 1 player that isnt good enough
[16:00:30] <aven0x> The weak link for faze is their fraggers not showing up or trying for to many hero plays :p
[16:01:18] <hjallemar> its the team composition and the team chemistry, having a few star players and some support players
[16:01:20] <pandasinparis> i think guardian is the weak point, hes mad overrated. he used to be sick though
[16:01:24] <VaeVictisKDmJ> RobbaN is their star player
[16:01:30] <pandasinparis> i dont think u need dedi awps in this meta. unless ur a kennyS.
[16:01:39] <hjallemar> not everyone can be a star player trying to make plays all the time
[16:01:41] <pandasinparis> and a few select others
[16:03:07] <+snigelguden> that jawline
[16:03:18] <zazacap> gg

[17:47:43] <epicgameplayer> haha not funny
[17:47:44] <+ChimeraCS> @jenniferconnelly reruns never get that many viewers
[17:47:45] <jenniferconnelly> renegades are kangaroo people
[17:47:46] <Ghosty_88> can't imagine what views if it was CS 1.6
[17:48:10] <jenniferconnelly> csgo major reruns should have at leasdt 100k viewers
[17:48:17] <Maedry> peak for 1.6 was 10-15k
[17:48:19] <VetKin214> @jenniferconnelly pretty sure this was last week
[17:48:36] <+ChimeraCS> it was last week this isnt live lol
[17:48:41] <Ghosty_88> @Maedry for real?
[17:48:45] <optanaka1> PUBG 4Head CS:GO PogChamp LOL KappaPride Dota ResidentSleeper
[17:48:47] <jenniferconnelly> cs 1.6 sucked. awful graphics and effects.
[17:48:51] <Maedry> @Ghosty_88 yes
[17:49:10] <+mlgtortle> anyone know the audio setting where everything has a bit more of a "boom"?
[17:49:20] <Ghosty_88> @jenniferconnelly lol. you must be this generation kiddo, not from our generationlol
[17:49:25] <jenniferconnelly> the graphics in cs1.6 sucked so much. thats why noone played it
[17:49:37] <Maedry> !mute jenniferconnelly
[17:49:40] <optanaka1> I love arma 3 i have 6k hours this game WTF
[17:49:43] <nolandwk> and now im turning off chat
[17:49:50] <+ChimeraCS> can we ban @jenniferconnelly
[17:49:58] <Ghosty_88> lol
[17:50:01] <VetKin214> @jenniferconnelly given the technology during the heydays of 1.6, there is no choice
[17:50:20] <Maedry> it's not all about graphics, it's mostly about engine.
[17:50:22] <jenniferconnelly> nope. cs 1.6 is a bad game compared to 2017 games. awful graphics. awful mechanic. awful gameplay. didnt sell
[17:50:31] <optanaka1> HeyGuys
[17:50:31] <Ghosty_88> atleast M4 had 90 max bullets in 1.6 lol
[17:50:36] <jenniferconnelly> the engine sucked too
[17:50:48] <+Agunbi> can you make a better game than 1.6?
[17:50:53] <Maedry> you suck more I guess
[17:51:02] <VetKin214> again that is 20/20 vision. there is no such advanced technology to support a better game during 1.6 development
[17:51:12] <cressboy79> heyo
[17:51:26] <VetKin214> because you have the technology nowadays
[17:51:51] <VetKin214> you are looking just on the user-end perspective. try looking on the development perspective
[17:52:11] <+Agunbi> graphics doesnt determine how good a game is..
[17:52:11] <+ChimeraCS> @VetKin214 obvious troll, dont feed in
[17:52:44] <Voltaire86> As if graphics were alpha omega in making a great game FailFish
[17:52:53] <VetKin214> well yeah @ChimeraCS , I'll stop at this point. it does not make any sense arguing with these narrow-sighted minds
[17:52:53] <@Moobot> http://open.dreamhack.se/news/436-astro-gaming-joins-as-title-sponsor-for-dreamhack-astro-open-2017.html
[17:53:08] <+Agunbi> jesus christ is there a way to mute on the twitch app
[17:53:17] <Ghosty_88> Poor kid seems like did have a great time. 1.6, arcade games, ps1 games lol
[17:53:32] <Ghosty_88> didn't have a great time*
[17:54:00] <VetKin214> she might not even know quake, unreal tournament, etc
[17:54:08] <Voltaire86> @jenniferconnelly hahahaha, how fucking ignorant you are
[17:54:21] <+Agunbi> no one cares jennifer just watch the tournament
[17:54:23] <epicgameplayer> Cod 2 was like most popular game before are you for real?
[17:54:24] <VetKin214> guys just let her be
[17:54:32] <Voltaire86> @jenniferconnelly Let me guess: You are quite young, aren't you? Like 18 years old or something like that?
[17:55:08] <epicgameplayer> I see lol
[17:55:19] <Voltaire86> hahaha, yes, and you think you know anything about the 1.6 scene?
[17:55:35] <Voltaire86> You were in kindergarden when it took place.
[17:55:47] <Voltaire86> : DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[17:55:52] <VetKin214> 15, so the day you were born was the days of cs's early heydays
[17:56:18] <epicgameplayer> Does any1 remember cod2 + xfire x) good days
[17:56:28] <Voltaire86> 15 years old. Born in 2002. And you think you know anything about counter-strike?
[17:56:29] <Ghosty_88> lol. this kid is a attention seeker. like @ChimeraCS said, Don't feed it.
[17:56:35] <VetKin214> there is a difference between "read about it" and "experienced it"
[17:56:51] <epicgameplayer> @VetKin214 Y
[17:57:03] <VetKin214> lets stop at this point guys
[17:57:06] <jenniferconnelly> doom wasnt part of "the greats"
[17:57:39] <Ghosty_88> :P
[17:57:43] <jenniferconnelly> @Tibbygaming nope. first cod was black ops 1. best cod of al time. thats when espn and xgames started to take notice
[17:57:46] <+ChimeraCS> not even master troll, bad troll, just mute
[17:57:51] <Voltaire86> I started playing CS in 2000. I was very active from 2001-2005. It's quite funny to listen to a 15-year-old who was not even born when 1.6 started.
[17:58:06] <jenniferconnelly> because BO1, gaming was for nerds. now it's for e-athletes like scump and optic.
[17:58:08] <+ChimeraCS> prob a boy anyways
[17:58:14] <epicgameplayer> Yo guyz you can actualy mute him, click on his name and on the right there is ignore user just press it plps
[17:58:35] <jenniferconnelly> optic gaming has a house for cod. lol what did the top cs1.6 team have 15 year ago? a duffle bag?
[17:58:41] <Voltaire86> You are right. It's not worth discussing with a child, or a troll for that matter Kappa
[17:59:05] <jenniferconnelly> @Voltaire86 noone cares about how "active" you were in a dead 15 year old game lol
[17:59:41] <VetKin214> User successfully ignored
[17:59:44] <Voltaire86> @jenniferconnelly noone cares about what you "read" about the game. You are a child with no knowledge talking shit online.
[17:59:49] <jenniferconnelly> youve all been trolled harde
[18:00:04] <jenniferconnelly> ive trolled all of you so hard

[18:00:29] <Voltaire86> yes, take refuge in that statement now
[18:00:38] <VetKin214> let's just say these kids assume that the internet before is as fast as today to support online gaming and esports LOL
[18:00:41] <jenniferconnelly> @Voltaire86 @Tibbygaming @VetKin214 users successfully trolled
[18:00:49] <Tibbygaming> Trolling in a Twitch chat in 2017, what a pleb

[18:01:43] <VetKin214> probably doesn't know that there is no Facebook, Twitch, Twitter during that time LOL
[18:02:05] <VetKin214> or smartphones for that matter
[18:02:22] <jenniferconnelly> @VetKin214 doesnt matter. if cs1.6 had better graphics and was a good game with high sales, ESPN or the news would have cared. they didn't. get over it
[18:02:23] <Tibbygaming> @vetkin214 He's 12 years old, what'd you expect
[18:02:46] <Ghosty_88> There was Messenger and Internet through Home telephone connection lol
[18:03:05] <jenniferconnelly> why does net speed matter? lol
[18:03:09] <VetKin214> hahaha yes, the dial-up one
[18:03:19] <jenniferconnelly> there was marketing back then. there was real sports
[18:03:25] <VetKin214> oh those days
[18:03:26] <Tibbygaming> Graphics don't make a game good, they add to the feel sure, a game's good if it's fun and played by many Lol

[18:12:26] <VetKin214> trolling being something that seems like a wonderful priviledge to those who do it
[18:13:05] <VetKin214> or something that gives people a sort of confidence or bragging rights

[20:21:29] <Hushhher> @rodri_ftw I'm not even swedish
[20:21:32] <Timmy_Tryhard> he asked me and i got curious, so i googled it :)
[20:21:42] <+Halibali> SeemsGood
[20:21:53] <Rodri_FTW> @hushhher i havent said that xD i was just saying xD
[20:22:04] <Hushhher> 2014 Winter Olympic Medal Count: Sweden - 15 medals / Spain - 0 medals
[20:22:35] <Timmy_Tryhard> Hushhher check totals instead, its way funnier, we have about the same amount of medals in winter olympics that they do total XD
[20:22:38] <+Halibali> Well they tried @Hushhher
[20:22:50] <Timmy_Tryhard> XD
[20:23:56] <chip1912> LOL there arnt many countries that re good at winter but if you think of 3 that are good its canada , sweden and russia
[20:24:07] <chip1912> are*
[20:24:19] <+Halibali> norway too
[20:24:24] <Timmy_Tryhard> chip1912 guess why i used winter sports instead of like... football xD
[20:24:28] <Hushhher> I'm just saying both countries have amazing athletes at different sports. One isn't "better" than the other. They are both great, but different.
