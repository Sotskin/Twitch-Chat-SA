[15:26:35] <gippig> havent seen them winning any inferno games , but they still play that shit and lose
[15:27:12] <gippig> also they suck at reading cache t side games against tier2-3 teams,
[15:27:27] <gippig> they cant read them because those teams play really really random
[15:27:36] <gippig> but they still choose to play that map
[15:27:41] <gippig> i dont understand xizt
