[13:07:04] <Superredoli> Everyone except big had a gentlemans agreement to not use jump bug
[13:07:25] <Superredoli> Krakow was the worst I've seen so far
[13:08:21] <epicicecubez> too many teamspeak issues, they should use skype Kappa
[13:08:47] <Superredoli> Discord is the best of both worlds
[13:09:11] <Superredoli> They should use it
[13:10:48] <epicicecubez> these pro plays, rush pop and walk through smokes

[1 day, 14:46:08] <TheCaptinAutismo> I know
[1 day, 14:53:10] <2akcf79> i wonder what happen if a fan stand up run to the team and shave there hairs mid match
[1 day, 14:54:48] <TheCaptinAutismo> security happens
[1 day, 14:55:05] <TheCaptinAutismo> they have bouncers around the stands
[1 day, 14:55:11] <2akcf79> you stunshock them :D so they cant move :D
[1 day, 14:55:27] <2akcf79> but a free shave is allways welcome
[1 day, 14:55:51] <TheCaptinAutismo> the yes move less if one of the giant guards just played on them lol
[1 day, 14:56:04] <2akcf79> i think they anyway in a box with windows ? and this white sound ?
[1 day, 14:56:37] <TheCaptinAutismo> it's essentially a giant drummers case that the 2 teams are in
[1 day, 14:56:50] <2akcf79> or better idea i play so good i get the 6th member of a team like this guy standing behind and giving order i work hard to get there then midgame i start shaving there hairs
[1 day, 14:57:12] <2akcf79> then i runaway hahah
[1 day, 14:57:34] <2akcf79> not sure do they got white noise too like in korea room case ?
[1 day, 14:57:42] <TheCaptinAutismo> you mean become a coach lol
[1 day, 14:57:54] <2akcf79> jeah coach haha
[1 day, 14:58:06] <2akcf79> just to shavethem for a troll
[1 day, 14:58:38] <2akcf79> "wut he worked 3 years with us just to live shave us and run away" strange manager - 2017
[1 day, 14:59:33] <2akcf79> is that a T map ?
[1 day, 15:00:29] <2akcf79> was t hinking faze was t he team that won the tournament
[1 day, 15:01:46] <WeStcr> YIYI
[1 day, 15:02:01] <TheCaptinAutismo> 80% of maps r t sided
[1 day, 15:02:13] <2akcf79> thats sad
[1 day, 15:02:28] <2akcf79> but i saw some maps they work very balanced
[1 day, 15:02:39] <2akcf79> i thin cubble and storport ?
[1 day, 15:03:09] <TheCaptinAutismo> cobble is ct
[1 day, 15:04:16] <2akcf79> sadly that there is not much balance somtimes i see 14:1 games on some maps
[1 day, 15:04:31] <2akcf79> then they almost make it back with 14:14
[1 day, 15:04:39] <WeStcr> All maps are ct, the pistols dicide that
[1 day, 15:05:13] <TheCaptinAutismo> that's cause teams are bad they aren't that huge of a difference
[1 day, 15:05:29] <2akcf79> somtimes its strange when 1 team is full armored 2nd team only eco pisotols and the TEAM w ith pistols win lol
[1 day, 15:06:02] <TheCaptinAutismo> and west that isn't true after round 3 if u lost on t you have better guns
[1 day, 15:06:25] <TheCaptinAutismo> better to me not to everyone
[1 day, 15:17:17] <2akcf79> looks bad for faze
[1 day, 15:17:43] <2akcf79> but it was crazy how they won the new york tournament like every map 16:3
