[5:50:34] <+alinio100> because they dont even hear them, it's a sound proof booth
[5:50:56] <fdeedat> but why?
[5:51:04] <+alinio100> csgo is going down
[5:51:24] <+alinio100> it's not going to die, that's a certainty, but it's only a tournament game now
[5:51:24] <+Brogans> CS:GOing down? Kappa
[5:52:13] <+Brogans> I find CS fun as hell to watch, but I can't play it with all the hackers everywhere anymore. Just not fun for me.
[5:53:09] <+Brogans> I don't care about the rank, it's just not fun playing against a hacker
[5:53:41] <machoka123123> there is no hackers just your not skilled
[5:54:12] <TheKillerRox> competitive is only ranked because the game needs to prevent unbalanced matches
[5:54:40] <TheKillerRox> the only thing he can do, its hide to you your rank
[5:54:54] <Lubbafellman> just curious what region you are playing, havent met more than like 1-5 obvious cheaters in the last 6months or so on eu servers with ranks between gn and global
[5:55:14] <TheKillerRox> but if you dont bother about your rank...its the same than now
