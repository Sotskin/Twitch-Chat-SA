[1:15:02] <+Tray_M> Yeah G2 won 2-1 vs SK
[1:15:16] <+Tray_M> VP doesn't need a lineup change
[1:15:16] <chef_keith> acidalia i think its a replay from 16 hours ago

[2:05:30] <Blackwolf48> FOTBOX
[2:05:32] <acetxlity> because CS casters are like that and its better tbh
[2:05:35] <Larzdafury> whatever what was left of liquid must have died of laughter after this game
[2:05:45] <acetxlity> nice and relaxed allowing us to watch the gameplay as well as listen
[2:05:55] <acetxlity> instead of screaming at us

[2:12:19] <tigre33> FAİLLEN LUL
[2:12:33] <Mojoner> Body is pretty much the only option though. He's a great site anchor, and no one in france wants to play with Kio and the rest is in EnvyUS. There are no other options.
[2:12:35] <pixel_br22> @xapadodedolly Mas agora eles estão parecendo bots,a g2 faz um rush,eles não recuam. Teve o rush na a que o taco ficou que nem o BOT Gaben na varanda!
[2:12:49] <sempper> How does overtime work pls?
[2:13:01] <acetxlity> Body is a good asset to G2, he should stay
[2:13:06] <tb0ne21> 3 T side, 3 CT side
[2:13:11] <+Kdlr12> nbk needs to leave
[2:13:16] <quevinsr> oh shit
[2:13:17] <+Junome89> 3 rounds each side and start with 16k
[2:13:19] <Treets56> @Mojoner there is LDLC, no good player there ?
[2:13:22] <+OTW2004> @Sempppp it is 6 rounds
[2:13:26] <acetxlity> who is g2's IGL?
[2:13:29] <Juicy0> lmao SK probably tilted. they should've won this map
[2:13:30] <snofffe> a team gets 4 points = winz with balloons and cake
[2:13:34] <tb0ne21> shox
[2:13:38] <+OTW2004> for each ot @Sempppp
[2:13:41] <C0D1G00> @andrew22br Igual aquele rush que eles fizeram na banana cavalando ai o cara matou os dois de UMP entrou B e ganhou
[2:13:42] <TheDragbit> Nobody needs to leave, what they need is practice
[2:13:46] <sempper> And if both team get 3 rounds xd ?
[2:13:50] <marcbayoud77> g2 being a french team should pick up some players from envyus such as scream
[2:13:56] <+Junome89> double ot
[2:13:57] <tb0ne21> another OT LUL
[2:13:59] <C0D1G00> @andrew22br nao tinha necessidade de rushar
[2:14:02] <+OTW2004> @Sempppp then another ot
[2:14:03] <marcbayoud77> it goes to double ot
[2:14:06] <+Kdlr12> g2 isnt a superteam like what people say
[2:14:06] <Mojoner> @Treets56, the only decent players on there are Maniac and Ex6, and both of those have been shunned by the rest of the French scene so that's not an option.
[2:14:13] <OriginalPaxa> @Kdlr12 Kappa
[2:14:16] <acetxlity> Scream for NBK would be good
[2:14:16] <pvvul> -body +ex6 igl
[2:14:18] <Mojoner> I don't think G2 needs to drop anyone, they just need more training.
[2:14:30] <WildPurple> i still pee in my bed
[2:14:32] <TheDragbit> @mojoner Exactly
[2:14:36] <Mojoner> @fallendice123, they all hate Ex6 though.
[2:14:41] <marcbayoud77> oh really? well that wasnt smart
[2:14:42] <acetxlity> they traded Scream because Kenny and Apex wanted to play with NBK
[2:14:43] <luisarmando0> noo
[2:14:44] <sempper> Thanks
[2:14:57] <x_idesolate> @Sempppp ots repeat until there is one winner. c9 vs navi on pgl went 34-32 for navi
[2:14:59] <+Kdlr12> nbk isnt good anymore like he used to
[2:15:01] <Stealthi> nbk and scream plays 2 different roles so that would not be optimal at all
[2:15:04] <hihelloxd> scream lol, probably said by someone who watched only his 2015/16 highlights

[6:37:46] <+alexd123> I hate SK, my least favorite team.
[6:37:52] <marcbayoud77> xD @d15cipl3
[6:37:58] <OmniShade_> I started as a FaZe fan back when I played CoD
[6:37:58] <bear_grylls_de> the problem is, in germany egoshooters are hated by politics
[6:38:00] <+alexd123> My fav are Faze anf navi
[6:38:08] <Blunttman> I don't get why they got spunj involved, he was never a good player and isn't even a good analyst. It's pathetic.
[6:38:12] <marcbayoud77> wait what happened to faze this tournament i didnt pay attention?
[6:38:15] <bear_grylls_de> faze is the most i like to watch

[6:39:02] <+d15cipl3> spunj is a funny guy tho it breaks up all the boring commentators like henry g and semmler
[6:39:07] <OmniShade_> Don't worry it's a CT sided map
[6:39:08] <Blunttman> Renegades has always been a joke team that shouldn't even be competing at majors/ @mcmitcho Me too, I can't stand him.
[6:39:09] <blaw_zula> NAVI LUL
[6:39:09] <bear_grylls_de> everyone who loses wants to lose against the tournament winner, thats less a shame

[7:56:05] <+Slick_Vaper209> thank you
[7:56:06] <LukyCSGOHD> @ekoleo rerun
[7:56:09] <marcbayoud77> i only play on my main when i go to a gaming lounge
[7:56:20] <+merq_cs> @marcbayoud77 you can have quad core i5, 8gb ram and some old graphics card for 300
[7:56:21] <mitcho> its g2, gambit, sk, nip for semis
[7:56:25] <marcbayoud77> yeah im thinking of building my own
[7:56:27] <ReliktGamingHD> stupid americans ....
[7:56:36] <+merq_cs> @marcbayoud77 it would obviously not be the best but you could run csgo at least 60+fps at all times
[7:56:37] <ezrang1> c9 trash
[7:56:38] <Mor0nSoldier> ^^^^^^
[7:56:42] <marcbayoud77> isnt a gtx 1050 card needed?
[7:56:51] <+Slick_Vaper209> i think that bracket is outdated guys SK Lost 2 G2 earlier.
[7:56:52] <Mor0nSoldier> nope
[7:56:54] <mojizmo> has an overpriced macbook and asks for money LUL
[7:56:57] <marcbayoud77> i ned 150+ fps
[7:57:03] <+Slick_Vaper209> h3h3Vape1 h3h3Vape2
[7:57:09] <Mor0nSoldier> Then yes might need dGPU
[7:57:11] <ezrang1> LUL
[7:57:13] <+Slick_Vaper209> h3h3Vape3 h3h3Vape4
[7:57:17] <marcbayoud77> 60 fps wouldnt be enough vs global elites
[7:57:19] <Mor0nSoldier> this is re-run dummy lol

[7:57:23] <Mysthatesdota> @iStemmy Yes SK lost to G2 1-2 yesterday
[7:57:26] <+Slick_Vaper209> yeh they lost 2 g2 that shit is outdated.
[7:57:36] <mitcho> source engine relies way more on cpu
[7:57:39] <+merq_cs> gtx 1050 is only required if ur trying to get 144hz monitor running
[7:57:52] <+merq_cs> even then you might be able to get it running with worse
[7:57:58] <Lowerade> 60 FPS IS THE BEST FPS
[7:58:01] <Mor0nSoldier> he said he needs 150+ fps might have a high Hz monitor then
[7:58:02] <scippa> LuL
[7:58:05] <420_allday_420> LOL
[7:58:09] <Lowerade> Kappa
