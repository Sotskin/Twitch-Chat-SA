[1 day, 12:52:55] <mewtykins> there was a couple lans after csgo launched. the csgo launch was so bad that a lot of top players didnt transfer over because they thought the game would fail
[1 day, 12:53:05] <mewtykins> navi was one team that refused to switch for a long time
[1 day, 12:53:07] <giveforas> this was the last cs 1.6 dreamhack no?

[1 day, 12:54:43] <salvoilmiosi> well csgo was very bad at launch, it's understandable
[1 day, 12:54:44] <mewtykins> navi and fnatic were winning everything for years at this point

[1 day, 12:59:47] <+DrLoveBond> DansGame
[1 day, 13:00:04] <mewtykins> i wish csgo would expand map pool
[1 day, 13:00:10] <mewtykins> source and 1.6 had bigger map pools
[1 day, 13:00:11] <+Art_btw_LUL> dis look like mirage lol
[1 day, 13:00:11] <+DrLoveBond> hey guys what do you think about the 100thieves team PogChamp
[1 day, 13:00:17] <salvoilmiosi> they need to add tuscan ffs
[1 day, 13:00:21] <+DrLoveBond> it's the old mirage
[1 day, 13:00:24] <mewtykins> tuscan was created
[1 day, 13:00:30] <xile1> @Art_btw_LUL because it is
[1 day, 13:00:31] <+DrLoveBond> I think it was called cpl something like that
[1 day, 13:00:35] <mewtykins> the new tuscan didnt succeed
[1 day, 13:00:43] <salvoilmiosi> ye but it's terrible, valve needs to remake it
[1 day, 13:00:56] <mewtykins> the original map creator did the csgo tuscan
[1 day, 13:01:05] <salvoilmiosi> valve needs to finally buy the map from brute
[1 day, 13:01:07] <mewtykins> he owns rights to it or somethign of the sort
[1 day, 13:01:20] <mewtykins> i want russka
[1 day, 13:01:35] <salvoilmiosi> same problem, it's the same guy
[1 day, 13:01:47] <+DrLoveBond> Ohh that stinks
[1 day, 13:01:59] <xile1> Can't buy it if he wont sell it
[1 day, 13:02:31] <salvoilmiosi> not to fmpone he won't, he said on reddit that he would sell it to valve
[1 day, 13:02:32] <+raka_gg> new cs ? PogChamp
[1 day, 13:02:41] <salvoilmiosi> idk if it's still true now tho
[1 day, 13:02:44] <+DrLoveBond> this is source 2.0 Kappa
[1 day, 13:02:50] <mewtykins> where is prodigy at??
[1 day, 13:02:54] <Fjort1z> so this is what the next cs will look like
[1 day, 13:02:59] <mewtykins> i want mill and fire back too
[1 day, 13:03:06] <+raka_gg> @salvoilmiosi what did fmpone say about what ?
[1 day, 13:03:20] <salvoilmiosi> i'm talking about brute, not fmpone
[1 day, 13:03:31] <+DrLoveBond> guys I don't like the new dust 2 BibleThump
[1 day, 13:03:34] <+raka_gg> you mentioned fmpone
[1 day, 13:03:43] <Fjort1z> the new dust2 is all cluttered
[1 day, 13:03:44] <+raka_gg> i came too late didnt see your messages before
[1 day, 13:03:53] <+raka_gg> d2 sucks
[1 day, 13:03:58] <+raka_gg> but i would prefer it over cobble
[1 day, 13:04:02] <salvoilmiosi> there is some drama about brute the maker of tuscan and fmpone
[1 day, 13:04:10] <Ellivlok23> yea
[1 day, 13:04:13] <Fjort1z> what drama
[1 day, 13:04:15] <salvoilmiosi> i mean, it was some time ago
[1 day, 13:04:34] <+raka_gg> fmpone created the bast map in csgo
[1 day, 13:04:42] <+raka_gg> best
[1 day, 13:04:50] <Ellivlok23> Brutes a piece of shit that doesnt care about tuscan or the community and valve wont let tuscan into MM
[1 day, 13:04:51] <Fjort1z> where is cs_militia
[1 day, 13:04:57] <salvoilmiosi> brute said that fmpone asked brute over and over to help him remake the map and he refused
[1 day, 13:05:24] <Fjort1z> well thats good considering tuscan was a piece of shit
[1 day, 13:05:28] <+raka_gg> who is brute
[1 day, 13:05:31] <Ellivlok23> yea because FMPONE wants to give the community what they want
[1 day, 13:05:39] <mewtykins> tuscan was only made to get around mill copyright
[1 day, 13:05:46] <mewtykins> but valve can remake mill. cpl isnt around anymore
[1 day, 13:05:56] <Ellivlok23> CAL is around
[1 day, 13:06:05] <mewtykins> mirage only came out cause strike was copyrighted
[1 day, 13:06:07] <Ellivlok23> CAL_Reloaded, they already made Mill and fire
[1 day, 13:06:08] <+raka_gg> season + aztec comeback pls
[1 day, 13:06:10] <salvoilmiosi> i don't get it, if cpl isn't around anymore, whose is mill now?
[1 day, 13:06:27] <mewtykins> mill became tuscan in 1.6 to get around the copyright @salvoilmiosi
[1 day, 13:06:32] <mewtykins> mill was played beginning of csgo on esea
[1 day, 13:06:36] <salvoilmiosi> ye i now that
[1 day, 13:06:43] <mewtykins> it got taken out of map pool quickly though
[1 day, 13:06:50] <mewtykins> we also had contra from source
[1 day, 13:07:05] <salvoilmiosi> i do remember all of that, i was around since csgo beta
[1 day, 13:07:12] <mewtykins> same
[1 day, 13:07:16] <Fjort1z> yung xizt
[1 day, 13:07:27] <mewtykins> the map pool is really limited in csgo. they need to rotate new maps in
[1 day, 13:07:30] <+DrLoveBond> xizt looks the same to me
[1 day, 13:07:32] <Lauen> wow is that Semmler?
[1 day, 13:07:43] <mewtykins> yes
[1 day, 13:07:43] <+raka_gg> semmler = kio
[1 day, 13:07:47] <ednbr> Edward too
[1 day, 13:07:58] <Fjort1z> semmler moving to overwatch :/
[1 day, 13:07:59] <+DrLoveBond> LOL awkward crowd
[1 day, 13:08:03] <+DrLoveBond> danCringe
[1 day, 13:08:18] <+raka_gg> semmler smart
[1 day, 13:08:22] <mewtykins> its crazy to think back in this year that quake live still had sponsors and tournaments
[1 day, 13:08:24] <+raka_gg> csgo done
[1 day, 13:08:29] <+DrLoveBond> oh yeah semmler leaving cs :((
[1 day, 13:08:37] <salvoilmiosi> well i still hope that some day brute swallows his pride and lets himself be helped by someone that know what he's doing, like fmpone or valve

[1 day, 13:09:35] <+DrLoveBond> Yeah it's so quiet LMAO
[1 day, 13:09:36] <Fjort1z> so tiny prizes too
[1 day, 13:09:40] <Lauen> insane how far the prizes have come now
[1 day, 13:09:43] <mewtykins> yeah, the prize pools were small at the end of 1.6
[1 day, 13:09:43] <+DrLoveBond> okay yeah there we go Kappa
