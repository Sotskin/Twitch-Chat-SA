[1 day, 13:05:58] <samfisher47_9> well there it goes Kappa
[1 day, 13:06:35] <samfisher47_9> SK won the biggest event over a year ago, was sick
[1 day, 13:06:57] <samfisher47_9> and they have the current best 2 players in the scene, pretty much everyone agrees to that
[1 day, 13:07:03] <packmastertony> niiice, i supported VP in dota glad to see they are in other pro scenes

[1 day, 13:07:52] <samfisher47_9> VP is really great as well, used to be a legendary team
[1 day, 13:08:07] <samfisher47_9> SK is just too strong for anyone currently
[1 day, 13:08:07] <gtowow1> right
[1 day, 13:08:07] <packmastertony> dam
