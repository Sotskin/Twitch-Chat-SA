[0:16:51] <darkfile81> serious question - i did not play 2 years and played again today and was pretty good
[0:17:10] <RedDragonFH> you missed the question mark
[0:17:11] <darkfile81> but it seems there are new weapons (revolver). are the existing weapons also changed?
[0:17:12] <Gameboy40> yes
[0:17:20] <RedDragonFH> a little
[0:17:39] <darkfile81> AK and M4 still seem to work good
[0:17:54] <darkfile81> pistols seem to be better now?

[0:21:31] <darkfile81> SK Gaming is it related to the old Schroet Kommando?
[0:22:02] <darkfile81> why do they have a brazil flag then? Schroet was a german team
[0:23:01] <RedDragonFH> @darkfile81 normally the meta is 2-3 UMP-MP probably drop one for a scout
[0:23:30] <darkfile81> lol that M4 spray also must be a new meta
