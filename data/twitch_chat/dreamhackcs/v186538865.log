[1 day, 9:09:11] <Q1_Tick> Who won this?
[1 day, 9:10:02] <daprezidentstreams> if renegades lose this its gonna be painful
[1 day, 9:11:15] <Q1_Tick> ok I'm out. The commentary is almost therapeutic.
[1 day, 9:12:30] <Q1_Tick> Spoiler: renegades lose LuL
[1 day, 9:12:57] <Q1_Tick> Legendary comeback
[1 day, 9:13:19] <Its_Hunter_k> they cant lose tho

[1 day, 9:15:42] <Nytharious> Sad miss haha
[1 day, 9:16:11] <Nytharious> It's kinda inevitable that even this far behind renegades lose, they are notorious for not being able to close games
[1 day, 9:16:36] <Q1_Tick> LuL
[1 day, 9:17:21] <Q1_Tick> brain exercise: what does my name come from?
[1 day, 9:17:33] <+99Thebigdady> my butthole perhaps
[1 day, 9:18:09] <Q1_Tick> You can't even understand that my question was intentionally mistaken
[1 day, 9:18:43] <Q1_Tick> no wonder you can type imbecilic things like tht
[1 day, 9:19:35] <Q1_Tick> You get an F- and a swift encouragement to rethink your future
[1 day, 9:19:53] <Nytharious> Well I mean calling him an imbecile is kinda missplaced considering with no context of course he wasn't going to understand
[1 day, 9:19:57] <Q1_Tick> @99thebigdady big daddy lmao. come on.
[1 day, 9:20:55] <Q1_Tick> I didn't call him. an imbecile. judging by the fact that you don't understand basic sentences, I find it amazing that you even know what imbecile means.
[1 day, 9:21:05] <Q1_Tick> Props, kid
[1 day, 9:22:08] <Q1_Tick> my name's origin overshadows your idiotic childish name
[1 day, 9:22:28] <Q1_Tick> just accept it and go with the flow

[1 day, 9:24:15] <Q1_Tick> thanks I'm surprised you love something
[1 day, 9:24:51] <Q1_Tick> it's quite funny that your 50 IQ brain can actually handle neurotransmitter synthesis in order for you to love something
[1 day, 9:25:01] <Q1_Tick> didn't know that's possible
[1 day, 9:25:23] <Q1_Tick> noted, thanks again. Please type more. in order for me to research.
[1 day, 9:26:31] <Q1_Tick> BTW, I'm punctuating wrong just because I don't want your brain to rust since it's a more advanced of a process to filter out the wrong full stops.
[1 day, 9:27:07] <Q1_Tick> I'll let you think on that last sentence until tomorrow. see you tomorrow, bye bye HeyGuys
[1 day, 9:27:37] <Nytharious> Btw quantic is a shitty name
[1 day, 9:28:34] <Q1_Tick> ok I think. my calculations for your IQ were wrong. new conclusion. is 40
