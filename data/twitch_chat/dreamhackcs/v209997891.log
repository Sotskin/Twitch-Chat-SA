[0:03:50] <mehmetakalin22> get right omg
[0:03:59] <mehmetakalin22> this man is the best player for sure
[0:04:20] <j0shC> because he waited?
[0:04:39] <mehmetakalin22> mate do you have any clue about his game sense
[0:04:43] <Slask33n> because he always waits
[0:04:49] <mehmetakalin22> and did you watch his match before
[0:04:55] <mehmetakalin22> no you did not and shut the hell up
[0:04:57] <G_wagon> his gamesense is crazy bro
[0:05:01] <Mrkiss2660> Yeah it takes great skill to wait
[0:05:11] <j0shC> Yes, and waiting for more players if one is blind doesnt mean he is the best
[0:05:19] <mehmetakalin22> this is not about waiting
[0:05:21] <+Promxtheism> Good game sense and he still gets destroyed in 80% of games
[0:05:31] <adamolmam> MamakClup
[0:05:33] <mehmetakalin22> he is not panicing at all
[0:05:43] <mehmetakalin22> which makes him pro player
[0:05:53] <j0shC> No one said he isnt
[0:06:56] <j0shC> how is that a question? Using a question mark on a statement? You can't even speak properly
[0:06:59] <oohcoo> wow, such a nice chat :^)
[0:07:03] <reoverkill> !score
[0:07:07] <Alastauminn> !viewmodel
[0:07:09] <prestonsaint> This is live??
[0:07:13] <reoverkill> no
[0:07:17] <+Promxtheism> You’re delusional if you think he’s up there with Coldzera, NiKo, s1mple, etc.
[0:07:21] <Mrkiss2660> !guns
[0:07:44] <G_wagon> in some aspects he is but coldzera is more skilled overall
[0:07:53] <+Promxtheism> He can play at their level one tournament per year
[0:07:58] <oohcoo> either way, you're all overreacting to this shit more than you probably should lmao
[0:08:53] <JllNZ> is this live
[0:08:54] <G_wagon> get right would be way better used on a team like astralis wih more skill around him
[0:09:03] <oohcoo> it is
[0:09:13] <oohcoo> a rerun
[0:09:13] <+Promxtheism> Yep, it’s live
[0:09:16] <Maarro> its not live
[0:09:17] <j0shC> I don't understand you, you say Get Right is the best just for not shooting his gun

[0:11:47] <mehmetakalin22> I hope you got it otherwise you should go doctor
[0:12:14] <oohcoo> get your daily dose from the doctor then
[0:12:18] <+Promxtheism> Your opinion is objectively incorrect
[0:12:38] <j0shC> Completely biased opinion then isn't it...
[0:13:20] <oohcoo> Horray for opinions! LUL
[0:15:07] <mehmetakalin22> jdc are you ok ?
[0:15:20] <j0shC> Yes, why?
[0:15:23] <mehmetakalin22> Can you tell me which part is biased ?
[0:15:53] <mehmetakalin22> what makes you think it is biased ?
[0:15:57] <j0shC> Everything you say about NiP as you've just said you love them...
[0:16:21] <j0shC> Or you said Get Right is your favourite
[0:16:26] <j0shC> So there you go
[0:16:30] <+Promxtheism> Get Right is your favorite player and you think he’s the best player, which is something nobody who watches the game would say
[0:16:33] <+airforce_gd> go NiP
[0:16:38] <nocch1> OMFG SIMPLE
[0:16:39] <mehmetakalin22> thank you you got it finally
[0:16:54] <mehmetakalin22> get right is my favourite I just wanted to say this
[0:17:02] <Dufulkappa> gtr is best player
[0:17:04] <j0shC> @Promxtheism atleast someone understands
[0:19:40] <mehmetakalin22> I don't get what do you mean nobody who watches the game would say
[0:19:48] <mehmetakalin22> my english is not good as like you
[0:20:04] <mehmetakalin22> promxtheism but anyway
[0:20:24] <notoriousgames4k> whats up with so low viewers :O ?
[0:20:44] <j0shC> He's saying that if you actually watched him all the time, then you would see that he isn't the best in CS
[0:20:49] <velace> Yeah RERUN is a good sponsor so i dont understand
[0:20:49] <itsHeaTq> @Promxtheism Actually thats his opinion, everyones allowed one and he's watching the game so im sure some people would agree with him, and there'
[0:20:52] <j0shC> @notoriousgames4k Rerun
[0:21:04] <itsHeaTq> ll be people who dont, but its an opinion theres no rights or wrongs
[0:21:17] <TrasioN> cause csgo sucks
[0:21:49] <j0shC> He's saying Get Right is the best, but obviously he would say that if he is his favourite
[0:22:07] <j0shC> @mehmetakalin22 no one is trashtalking you
[0:22:14] <itsHeaTq> yeah but thats his opinion you dont have to agree with that or comment on it
[0:22:42] <j0shC> Well it's my opinion and many others that he isn't
[0:23:20] <itsHeaTq> thats fine but many others would disagree with you, theres no right or wrong here, no ones incorrect
