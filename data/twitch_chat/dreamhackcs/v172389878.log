[7:43:05] <ihatedankmemes> PogChamp
[7:44:23] <UtopiaPlanitia> i hate NAVI so much, NIP is CULT and they would deserve a nother Major Triumph
[7:45:39] <Bambosh94> Im fan of VP u know im from PL, but i like the NiP as well
[7:45:59] <kingdoosan> nip has won many majores. naVi deserves it more
[7:46:28] <Bambosh94> And i do not understand NaVi's move with Zeus
[7:46:34] <kingdoosan> NiP was the best team for years, its about time someone started owning them
[7:46:52] <Bambosh94> He deserves to win Major but Navi do not deserve to have Zeus in their roster
[7:46:53] <kaliburdannet> lul
[7:47:01] <OliverT123> haha

[7:48:25] <Pandrow85> @dooshii lel NiP has only won 1 Major, fnatic 3
[7:48:39] <kingdoosan> how old are you lol
[7:48:53] <kingdoosan> NiP has been a clan for decades almost
[7:49:07] <Pandrow85> @dooshii doesn't matter if I have a point
[7:49:19] <Pandrow85> it's a fact :P
[7:49:21] <Bambosh94> Golden Five has been together for the loong time :P
[7:49:25] <Nielsoooo> aa wrong pont

[7:50:10] <Bambosh94> There is any info about Hiko's new team ?
[7:50:12] <Pandrow85> @dooshii okay true, I thought you mean CS:GO only
[7:50:13] <kingdoosan> f0rest is the guy with most talent
[7:50:29] <kingdoosan> i never said CSGO only
[7:50:51] <Koas> Nah simple

[7:50:54] <sch1zophrenic_> cant really measure talent
[7:50:54] <BassieNL> forestttttt
[7:51:06] <Bambosh94> Guys i have aquestion, any of you playing FaceIt and use anti cheat at win7 ?
[7:51:10] <+BLITZiwnl> ye u can
[7:51:20] <Pandrow85> @dooshii I know, but since we are watching CS:GO and NiP had a different roster back in 1.6
[7:51:33] <Bambosh94> The app tells me that my windows is out of date ;/
[7:51:38] <kingdoosan> well i ment the clan in general. nothing more
[7:51:42] <+BruceLegend> i wish draken would date me
[7:51:43] <sch1zophrenic_> in terms of consistency hes definetly not
[7:51:51] <trollfacegamer56> qea
[7:52:00] <kingdoosan> @Pandrow85 the point is, its cool at theres more people good now, not ONLY NiP or fnatic. right?
[7:52:00] <chipsubinited> did g2 manage to go semi final or sk?
[7:52:06] <sch1zophrenic_> with that haircut aye xd

[7:52:47] <decottv> G2
[7:52:55] <kingdoosan> i think the won instantly
[7:52:56] <Bambosh94> What do you think who gonna win the ELeague ?
[7:52:57] <sch1zophrenic_> isnt finale bo5?
[7:53:07] <Pandrow85> @dooshii yeah, that's true :) would be boring... but I like NiP because of the players, not because of the org
[7:53:11] <chipsubinited> i m gonna say g2
[7:53:12] <+BruceLegend> \m/ SwiftRage \m/
[7:53:13] <sch1zophrenic_> Renegades lol xd
[7:53:19] <kingdoosan> @Pandrow85 i agree
[7:53:25] <the_misirlou> when will the final match start???
[7:53:28] <chipsubinited> CLG Red?
[7:53:42] <kingdoosan> twitchburanebeklion G2 Esports won dreamhakc
[7:53:54] <kingdoosan> the french guys
[7:54:06] <kingdoosan> kennyS etc.
[7:54:14] <the_misirlou> against who?
[7:54:18] <Pandrow85> @dooshii also I would like to see NiP finally winning tournaments again, since they have been in a very long slump recently
[7:54:19] <dontphone> die
[7:54:27] <+BruceLegend> spam the kraken Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid4 to help draken
[7:54:27] <kingdoosan> against NiP i think

[7:54:53] <dontphone> a
[7:55:03] <kingdoosan> @Pandrow85 thats true,they went from HERO to ZERO, so ye. they could deserve a win now, or maybe tey will disaband the clan
[7:55:37] <kingdoosan> they are all good players. they just need a fresh start tbh
[7:55:43] <Bambosh94> The same is now with VP they came from Hero to zero atm. But i believe that they need to half of a year to back to the top
[7:55:59] <kingdoosan> exactly bambo
[7:56:24] <Bambosh94> Snax have no experien as IGL so they need to practice a lot
[7:56:36] <Bambosh94> But i proud of them how they managed at PGL
[7:57:00] <+BLITZiwnl> s1mple nice bloodsport
[7:57:22] <Bambosh94> But on polish site there is a lot of haters on VP for they plays now ;/ it's nothing good for the team

[11:35:31] <+pavlikos777> @Etniuh so true, eh
[11:36:10] <Ghosty_88> But Dosia is Russian so...
[11:36:30] <Ghosty_88> The rest of the time are All Kazakh
[11:36:46] <Ghosty_88> damnnnn. almost had it
[11:36:53] <themes12> lol
[11:37:03] <+wigggle> why not make it 10,000 IQ? let's make it meaningless
[11:37:05] <+Sniperkid97> he would've had it if he shot a split second earlier
[11:37:17] <VetKin214> missed the first shot, killed those at long range, them misses the short range shot again
[11:37:48] <yoctoh> a
[11:38:01] <Ghosty_88> bro, after the 2nd kill, out of the blue he jumped in. would have been a chance if killed him
[11:39:01] <Siginek123> who is sub?
[11:39:29] <Agustin_SanS> XGOD ?
[11:39:39] <Ghosty_88> sub is bus's cousin
[11:39:59] <Ghosty_88> Kappa
[11:40:07] <VetKin214> Kappa
[11:40:46] <VetKin214> too good at sprays long range
[11:41:03] <Ghosty_88> ;)
[11:42:37] <VetKin214> I did not expect Gambit to make it this far after Zeus' exit
[11:43:19] <VetKin214> smart Xyp
[11:43:40] <Be4st23> it wasnt just gambit looking decent but astralis looked lost
[11:44:07] <Banikx> Gambit has momentum
[11:44:10] <VetKin214> well, they're not the "boring", tactical astralis of the past months
[11:44:29] <papouiii> playing like silvers
[11:44:39] <VetKin214> the "boring" coming from people who does not like the no-flare, all-business astralis approach
[11:44:58] <VetKin214> it seems astralis lost their mojo
[11:45:22] <Banikx> faze was disappointing too imo
[11:45:44] <VetKin214> at least, faze have the leeway of 2 new teammates
[11:46:02] <spoonsforlife> @vetkin214 . olof and?
[11:46:13] <VetKin214> guardian
[11:46:16] <Banikx> Guardian
[11:46:20] <spoonsforlife> ty
[11:46:47] <VetKin214> it might be hard for karrigan to manage 3 explosive, impulsive players hahaha
[11:46:48] <yung_obdrister> gambit win major !!!
[11:46:59] <VetKin214> niko, olof and guardian on the same team lol
[11:47:19] <spoonsforlife> whats the next live match?

[11:52:16] <+konedj> is this a recorded version? I thought DH already happened lol

[11:53:01] <+konedj> why are they streaming this again?
[11:53:01] <Grefali> Cant read? @konedj
[11:53:16] <Grefali> RERUN: Astralis vs Gambit - Mirage - Quarter-final - DreamHack Masters Malmö 2017
[11:53:18] <+konedj> RERUN
[11:53:35] <Grefali> Yes, well read
[11:53:56] <+konedj> well, RERUN doesnt make any sense to me
[11:54:10] <+konedj> replay would
[11:54:13] <spoonsforlife> they gotta fill the gaps
[11:54:24] <chaca_pt> EX god has the nouse very very redy xD
[11:54:34] <Banikx> they are rurunning the whole tourney
[11:54:41] <spoonsforlife> replay and rerun arent quite the same
[11:54:59] <VetKin214> I think they ruled out the replay word in twitch because every game is played I think?
[11:55:16] <VetKin214> a replay in a gaming channel might imply something different
[11:55:49] <VetKin214> but they should be using rebroadcast IMO
[11:55:51] <Grefali> if this was a marathon stream, it couldnt be named rerun
[11:56:07] <VetKin214> same logic Kappa
[11:56:10] <spoonsforlife> then it would be named marathon
[11:56:25] <Grefali> ??
[11:56:37] <Grefali> You get it? the running event
[11:56:47] <VetKin214> yeah yeah

[15:43:31] <dankboogle> Hello,
[15:43:35] <becmoth> who won in the final ?
[15:43:47] <dankboogle> gambit
[15:43:57] <becmoth> cool
[15:44:10] <dankboogle> Ranks?
[15:44:18] <mixmaster_mark> g2 :|
[15:44:48] <dankboogle> Why are you still playing jk youre not silver so. im ge/lem smurfing
[15:45:37] <dankboogle> Anyone wanna give me a knife
[15:45:38] <Outsmarthin> ive underestimated draken - that was huge
[15:45:50] <+TDans> PogChamp
[15:45:54] <dankboogle> Yes.
[15:46:14] <dankboogle> Thay all play same cross hair?
[15:46:41] <+Sniperkid97> Draken carried vs Na'Vi or whoever they played earlier
[15:46:51] <Outsmarthin> its the ch of the observer obviously
[15:47:17] <dankboogle> g2 needs shroud stew and get right it would be the best csgo team ever
[15:47:56] <Outsmarthin> shroud is terrible atm, stew is more of a pug
[15:48:24] <Gerengnick> i mean shroud doesnt play much at all anymore
[15:48:25] <Outsmarthin> i woud only change boddy for konfig
[15:48:39] <Gerengnick> boddy is a good anchor
[15:48:47] <dannygranum> g2 doesn't need any changes, they just won dreamhacks xD
[15:49:59] <Dlstrm> @dankboogle no thats only the Spector sight
[15:51:23] <PuhaDK> why is 1250 ppl watching a rerun? G2 wubs DH
[15:53:28] <FiftyHP> @PuhaDK because people watch for tips on getting better and strats
[15:53:37] <VetKin214> I was not able to watch this one last week, so I'm watching the rerun
[15:53:57] <+aka_asor> it's entertaining...
[15:54:18] <mixmaster_mark> ^
[15:54:23] <Outsmarthin> this is kinda the actual final
[15:54:46] <+Sniperkid97> I love how watching a rerun is wrong so he had to come in to comment and spoil the results
[15:54:59] <vohiyolist> EleGiggle BRA7-1L EleGiggle BRONZIL EleGiggle
[15:55:49] <VetKin214> it doesn't matter to me if someone spoils the result. I want to watch how it happened, not what the result is
[15:56:21] <Outsmarthin> same here
[15:57:00] <+Sniperkid97> I don't play or care much for CS: GO but i find it entertaining to watch the esports things, but i still consider him a douche for spoiling a rerun for the hell of it
[15:57:08] <Outsmarthin> rez and draken sure arent random people - they can play
[15:57:47] <VetKin214> draken can definitely play. I forgot what team he was when he's playing at starladder
[15:57:49] <Outsmarthin> can they win events... we will have to see
[15:58:07] <VetKin214> but I was able to watch him play

[17:54:13] <Ghosty_88> gambit was destroying their opponent on Quarter
[17:54:30] <NiZiO> yess
[17:56:04] <Outsmarthin> North were one of the big boys
[17:56:22] <Outsmarthin> I think they even won vs Faze previously without guardian in
[17:56:43] <Ghosty_88> had no idea North was this good. Sadly didn't watch their games before..
[17:57:13] <Outsmarthin> well, konfig was awesome
[17:57:21] <Ghosty_88> NiP after Navi was like "NiP vs North in the finals. Sweden vs Denmark
[17:57:25] <Outsmarthin> cajun did almost as good as actual awper
[17:57:41] <Ghosty_88> indeed

[17:58:25] <Ghosty_88> true that.

[18:01:57] <Ghosty_88> @Outsmarthin
[18:02:24] <Ghosty_88> @Outsmarthin SK were close to beating G2, but the comeback in Overpass and Inferno took them out
[18:02:35] <Ghosty_88> the final was in Overpass.
[18:02:46] <Ghosty_88> SK made many errors..

[21:48:59] <F2uness> he is definitely back
[21:49:26] <Bigbubble89> I want to see g2 fuuck sk anal
[21:49:36] <paniinii_> same
[21:49:46] <F2uness> they already did didnt they xD
[21:49:46] <@Moobot> http://open.dreamhack.se/news/436-astro-gaming-joins-as-title-sponsor-for-dreamhack-astro-open-2017.html
[21:49:46] <Bigbubble89> I love this g2
[21:50:01] <tynnh13> any can send me skins? :s
[21:50:07] <Bigbubble89> so damn strong
[21:50:09] <F2uness> i feel as though if G2 keep this consistently, they are by far the best team in the world
[21:50:17] <paniinii_> I think KennyS is the best again tbh. I mean Draken seems dangerous and good against him.
[21:50:18] <tynnh13> i love g2
[21:50:28] <paniinii_> yya
[21:50:28] <F2uness> i know right. legit a super team with Shox and Kenny
[21:50:43] <paniinii_> I like bodyy on this team too
[21:50:43] <Bigbubble89> this g2 guys is best than ever
[21:50:44] <TooMatcho> I dab on this stream btw.
[21:50:50] <F2uness> Draken is 2nd best behind kenny imo
[21:50:57] <Bigbubble89> nothing must change
[21:51:01] <paniinii_> true
[21:51:01] <Sw4nkyK3ttl3> New FaZe line up contests to be the best team
[21:51:14] <Bigbubble89> and they will be unbeatable
[21:51:19] <paniinii_> olofmeister is iffy nowadaysthough
[21:51:20] <F2uness> kenny just, if he is on, he is just the best
[21:51:37] <Bigbubble89> don't think so @sw4nkyk3ttl3
[21:51:43] <Sw4nkyK3ttl3> Why not?
[21:52:09] <paniinii_> i love bodyy
[21:52:10] <F2uness> i have no idea, i think i tiwll be G2 North, faze, SK, and gambit/cloud9 top 5 in that order
[21:52:21] <Bigbubble89> can remember to me new faze line
[21:52:26] <F2uness> cloud9 if they cope as a team and can get it going
[21:52:35] <Sw4nkyK3ttl3> Yeah new cloud9 has a lot of potential
[21:52:43] <F2uness> it does
[21:53:05] <Bigbubble89> @sw4nkyk3ttl3 new teamline from faze?
[21:53:33] <paniinii_> Draken is almost as good as KennyS mainly because he is almost as qquick
[21:53:47] <paniinii_> I mean both of their flicks are god-tier
[21:53:53] <F2uness> yeah
[21:54:04] <F2uness> But kenny is faster. way faster
[21:54:15] <Bigbubble89> Kenny smarter
[21:54:15] <paniinii_> tru tru
[21:54:16] <F2uness> and his flicks are just. u break ur wrist if u arent kenny
[21:54:28] <F2uness> also that as well he is smarter
[21:54:32] <paniinii_> i mean Kenny has like nanosecond reaction time lol
[21:54:50] <paniinii_> like that
[21:54:53] <F2uness> ikr
[21:55:03] <Bigbubble89> yep
[21:55:15] <Sw4nkyK3ttl3> Isnt it rain, k1o, guardian, niko and someone else
[21:55:16] <Bigbubble89> godfeel
[21:55:21] <F2uness> if Kenny is on fire, his reaction time is not matched. he cant be beat, he is legit a trump card
[21:55:25] <Sw4nkyK3ttl3> Faze lineup^
[21:55:44] <Bigbubble89> ze us?
[21:56:03] <paniinii_> That's KennyS's weakness though, he isn
[21:56:21] <paniinii_> but when he is... Oh boy
[21:56:45] <Sw4nkyK3ttl3> Spoilered :(
[21:56:46] <paniinii_> yeah it is rerun!
[21:56:49] <F2uness> rain guardian niko. olof karrigan
[21:56:56] <Bigbubble89> love apex tick's!
[21:57:00] <paniinii_> damn nice
[21:57:06] <F2uness> Faze lineup is that ^^
[21:57:14] <Sw4nkyK3ttl3> Looks great
[21:57:20] <Bigbubble89> yep
[21:57:38] <Bigbubble89> agree
[21:58:01] <paniinii_> damn
[21:58:26] <Sw4nkyK3ttl3> Damn. Ill have to forgive bro, not like i couldnt have guessed ❤️
[21:58:40] <Bigbubble89> olof is weak I think nowdays
[21:58:42] <Sw4nkyK3ttl3> Hshahahahaha
[21:58:53] <paniinii_> he is inconsistent i think
[21:58:56] <Sw4nkyK3ttl3> WEAK?!?!?!
[21:59:29] <Sw4nkyK3ttl3> Olof is still a top 10 player
[21:59:32] <paniinii_> North is such a bad name, no creativity
[21:59:40] <Bigbubble89> weak beast better?
[21:59:45] <F2uness> i actually like it
