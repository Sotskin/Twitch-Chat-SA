[20:54:02] <marvjenapenjaze> are you idiot ?
[20:54:20] <marvjenapenjaze> learn english and than say that
[20:54:31] <marvjenapenjaze> learn english and than say that.
[20:54:40] <mrhybreed> then
[20:54:41] <marvjenapenjaze> learn english and than say that...
[20:55:33] <VetKin214> correcting someone's english while being wrong himself. How ironic
[20:55:50] <mrhybreed> lol
[20:56:10] <FlamyGregy> Well played @mrhybreed
[20:56:24] <mrhybreed> :-)
[20:56:55] <mrhybreed> I'm ready for this weekend's tournament in NY
[20:57:32] <mrhybreed> ESL that is...
[20:57:36] <VetKin214> Is ESL ONE NY this weekend?
[20:57:52] <VetKin214> I see, thanks for the info
[20:57:55] <mrhybreed> yeah...starts on the 15th I believe
[20:58:41] <dark4veng3r> who is the best fer or condzera?
[20:59:45] <VetKin214> Well, tbh both of them seems like on a funk streak
[20:59:45] <mrhybreed> Olafmeister :-)
[21:00:21] <+Ojinoshi> doodSteve
[21:00:26] <mrhybreed> I was gonna say that @VetKin214
[21:00:47] <mrhybreed> SK had a rough time in Montreal for sure...
[21:01:02] <VetKin214> definitely, it's cringe-inducing
[21:01:16] <VetKin214> they do mistakes that are not SK-esque
[21:01:31] <VetKin214> I mean DID mistakes
[21:01:39] <mrhybreed> yeah agree
[21:08:12] <VetKin214> I think SK last played in Mykonos, but yeah they struggled there
[21:08:12] <@Moobot> DreamHack Store: http://store.dreamhack.com/?utm_source=twitch_CS&utm_campaign=twitch_panel&utm_medium=twitch
[21:11:15] <tom711911> Someone hear watch GoT Please whisper me IF so
[21:12:40] <mrhybreed> Ah you're correct Vet. It was Mykonos.
[21:14:21] <VetKin214> Too bad we will not see oskar on that tournament. He's on fire recently
[21:14:43] <mrhybreed> yeah he's a beast
[21:15:32] <shinyjade> DRAKKKEEEEEENNNNNNNNN
[21:15:49] <mrhybreed> I'm really looking forward to seeing Faze and also C9. Their rosters are looking good!
[21:16:21] <shinyjade> YEAH SAME
[21:16:58] <VetKin214> I also have high hopes for Faze. They did well in their last event given the limited practice time
[21:17:33] <VetKin214> Having to manage 3 explosive-impulsive players may take a toll on karrigan LOL
[21:18:24] <mrhybreed> lmao I hear that! They will only get better with some practice too.
[21:18:24] <ahmad_1o> !subcount
[21:19:02] <mrhybreed> And Olaf looks real comfortable on Faze. He's doing a LOT better.
[21:19:49] <VetKin214> Well, he seems to be a little tamed. To be honest, I'm not used to it LOL
[21:20:27] <mrhybreed> Yeah there's a lot less yolo play it seems. Which is what he needed lol.
[21:21:25] <ahmad_1o> g2 2-0 right
[21:21:25] <VetKin214> That role definitely belongs to NiKo. But Olof may get his chunk when permitted hahaha
[21:22:22] <mrhybreed> I was kinda sad seeing him leave Fnatic but happt for him being in Faze.
[21:23:32] <aBxCRACKtwitch> whats that arm sticker?
[21:24:57] <VetKin214> I believe it is there to reduce stress on the wrist area? like what basketball players use on their shoulders
[21:25:19] <aBxCRACKtwitch> k ty :)

[1 day, 19:00:12] <ChinesaApertada> what are these eyeslashs?
[1 day, 19:00:14] <+oopsthatismine> That job will be based on your grades, you won't get it if your grades are trash
[1 day, 19:00:15] <rawl1337> the kid has it all figured out hes only 17
[1 day, 19:00:29] <Mayo_man_2013> Vans get paid 15/h Semi Trucks get 30/h

[1 day, 19:08:40] <+oopsthatismine> and tbh it probably is bs, there's no way that a company would just give you a job without any qualifications
[1 day, 19:09:00] <+oopsthatismine> much less a 15/hour job
[1 day, 19:09:32] <+oopsthatismine> Nah there's no way
[1 day, 19:09:58] <+oopsthatismine> Maybe they said "If you get these grades then yes" but they wouldn't do that
[1 day, 19:10:15] <+oopsthatismine> Trust me I work in recruitment for a company
[1 day, 19:10:35] <+oopsthatismine> I know this stuff
[1 day, 19:11:49] <+oopsthatismine> Bro there's no way
[1 day, 19:12:21] <+oopsthatismine> I know how this works, this isn't how it works
[1 day, 19:13:26] <+oopsthatismine> No, there's no way that a company would gamble like that
[1 day, 19:14:37] <Mayo_man_2013> dude i live in a place of jesus freaks and humble people they have way to much trust

[1 day, 19:18:41] <+oopsthatismine> Why would they hire 2 years in advance lmao
[1 day, 19:18:54] <beezlibub> wow that was a creepy smile
[1 day, 19:19:30] <+oopsthatismine> As I said, I work in recruitment. They wouldn't gamble like that and they wouldn't hire 2 years in advance.
[1 day, 19:19:40] <Mayo_man_2013> no i have a spot guranted for me when i graduate aslong as i get my CDL this year
