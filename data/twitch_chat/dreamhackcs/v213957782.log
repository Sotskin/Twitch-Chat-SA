[9:18:10] <+enjoyheyo> those weird quiznos commercials with those furby things with teeth
[9:18:12] <Rommlel> sorry

[9:19:03] <Stigma1996> My hopes are too high
[9:20:14] <Rommlel> That's a bit of an understatement
[9:20:29] <+enjoyheyo> Why is NA so bad?
[9:20:43] <Rommlel> Atleast NA is better than AU teams
[9:20:55] <Stigma1996> Because no one is willing to put their egos aside to put a team together dedicated to winning
[9:22:56] <Stigma1996> We also have no decent IGLs
[9:24:53] <Rommlel> EU teams also work harder tbh

[1 day, 5:07:58] <marcelsmom> holy shit yea
[1 day, 5:08:21] <marcelsmom> bottt
[1 day, 5:08:54] <zelot227> Olaf is doing so much better on faze, I think he didn’t want to awp anymore
[1 day, 5:09:35] <+freeman4096> wrong. he may be better awper than porkW, but he's not Guardian.
[1 day, 5:09:57] <marcelsmom> who are we talking about
[1 day, 5:10:02] <zelot227> I never said he was better XD
[1 day, 5:10:18] <zelot227> All I said is that he likes it more on faze and it shows in the ya he plays
[1 day, 5:10:38] <zelot227> And that I think he is ok with guardian being the awp and not him
[1 day, 5:10:39] <+freeman4096> if he wants to awp on faze or not is irrelevant, if strat requires only 1 awper then he's out of luck
[1 day, 5:10:52] <zelot227> Lol
[1 day, 5:11:13] <zelot227> Why are you trying to start a fight over the internet lol
[1 day, 5:11:19] <marcelsmom> olof is rifler
[1 day, 5:11:21] <zelot227> LUL
[1 day, 5:11:28] <marcelsmom> but he can also awp
[1 day, 5:11:33] <marcelsmom> on faze
[1 day, 5:11:40] <zelot227> Lol
[1 day, 5:11:48] <zelot227> Read my words
[1 day, 5:11:50] <+freeman4096> olof was always a lurker, but so is karrigan, I dont think he's that great addition for them. any good rifler would do. other faze players are irreplacable.
[1 day, 5:12:13] <+freeman4096> olof overrated imo
[1 day, 5:12:32] <zelot227> He doesn’t need to be a star that’s the job of the other 4
[1 day, 5:12:41] <zelot227> He just needs to not be a sped
