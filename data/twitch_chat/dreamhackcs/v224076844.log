[21:05:01] <Maliknb1> Bye mazzafakka
[21:19:40] <+Typ1calGamez> old csgo looked so much better imo
[21:20:24] <QueinTV> pro matches pre 2016 were more interesting as well imo
[21:21:34] <+Typ1calGamez> better cuz there wasnt the faze superteam c9 superteam etv @QueinTV it was basically all fnatic which wasnt bad
[21:21:42] <+Typ1calGamez> etc*
[21:21:54] <QueinTV> the average level is way higher now
[21:22:14] <QueinTV> which in return means that you see less and less incredible individual plays
[21:22:23] <+Typ1calGamez> i miss fox
[21:22:41] <+Typ1calGamez> fox was nuts
[21:22:56] <+Typ1calGamez> does he still play?
[21:23:07] <QueinTV> I think so
[21:23:22] <+Typ1calGamez> not on a well known team if he does
[21:23:22] <QueinTV> in kinguin
[21:23:51] <QueinTV> they're the 2nd best from team in Poland
[21:24:01] <FL1NDT> greatest semi final of 2015
[21:24:37] <QueinTV> I think part of the reason Fox was so good was that he wasn't punished as much for his overly aggressive play style as he is now
[21:25:12] <QueinTV> in Dignitas I felt they lost so many rounds on CT side because he just went way to over aggressive and got himself killed for no reason
[21:28:48] <liinor> are there drops too?
[21:29:10] <TUL1NE> xd no
[21:29:29] <liinor> so you steal all the drops ok
[21:29:51] <TUL1NE> only on majors there are souvenir drops
