[15:49:39] <+Dizznasty_> Oh shit! was this the game where SK rushed banana like idiots??????
[15:49:43] <Timmy_Tryhard> SK throwing hard bruuuuuh
[15:50:57] <maceedolucas> Aimlock tho
[15:51:16] <+Dizznasty_> I'm positive this was the map a CT side rushes down banana for no reason. idk if it was this game/team
[15:52:12] <+Dizznasty_> HERE IT IS
[15:52:13] <Ydiaby3> lol y?
[15:52:22] <youwizard> LUL BANANA RUSH
[15:52:27] <+Dizznasty_> the DUMBEST play EVER!
[15:52:30] <h4yden_> how to throw a game lesson 1
[15:52:44] <Timmy_Tryhard> Dizznasty_ trust me, ive seen worse :')
[15:52:50] <+Dizznasty_> no info and the RUN??? so early in the round.
[15:53:24] <Timmy_Tryhard> Dizznasty_ and not only one, but two!
[15:53:32] <+Dizznasty_> ^^^^
[15:53:53] <Timmy_Tryhard> "i would go crazy if i were fallen right now" and the timeout comes XD
[15:54:02] <+Dizznasty_> lololl
[15:54:05] <Timmy_Tryhard> baba fallen is telling them off
[15:54:09] <h4yden_> lol
[15:54:22] <+Dizznasty_> like you HAVE the 15th round. why? lol
[15:54:45] <h4yden_> that was disgusting
[15:54:48] <Timmy_Tryhard> Dizznasty_ its not like they were superstrapped for cash either (usually the reason why u do weird/stupid plays)
[15:55:19] <+Dizznasty_> exactly! no reason to do that FailFish
[15:55:40] <+Dizznasty_> cuz NOW they got no money lol
[15:55:53] <+Dizznasty_> and they gotta wait like 2-3 rounds for more money
[15:55:57] <Timmy_Tryhard> this is the round shit like that could work XD
[15:56:13] <+Dizznasty_> with makes the other team have 13-14.
[15:56:25] <+Dizznasty_> yup @Nyere88
[15:56:36] <Timmy_Tryhard> 2-3 rounds? rly bro? XD what teams are u playing with? 3 ecos? XD
[15:57:11] <+Dizznasty_> keep watching. so far they are on their 2nd eco
[15:57:34] <+minecrafters2017> Ooh fireworks
[15:57:48] <Timmy_Tryhard> Dizznasty_ not rly true, they bought some pistols and still had money from lsat so :p
[15:57:58] <Timmy_Tryhard> this is 1st eco rly
[15:58:06] <+Dizznasty_> but they didn't all fully buy
[15:58:20] <Timmy_Tryhard> last round they bought up didnt they?
[15:58:26] <+Dizznasty_> imagine 4 m4's and 1 awp?
[15:58:27] <maceedolucas> Apex is playing crazy
[15:59:01] <youwizard> He should be MVP instead of kenny imo
[15:59:02] <Timmy_Tryhard> just wait, 2018 faze will win 90% :|
[15:59:15] <+Dizznasty_> LuL
[15:59:20] <Ydiaby3> ikr
[15:59:21] <Timmy_Tryhard> its not only about how many frags you have
[15:59:40] <Timmy_Tryhard> 2 impact frags are worth more than 3 on a losing round ;p
[15:59:47] <Ydiaby3> all his frags were impactful imo
[15:59:54] <h4yden_> sk totally lost their shit after that rush
[15:59:58] <youwizard> exactly
[15:59:58] <Timmy_Tryhard> yeah, i cant disagree to that
[16:00:18] <Timmy_Tryhard> yeah, prolly tilted and scared of team balance now :\
[16:00:25] <Ydiaby3> they helped g2 win so the kills mean something here
[16:00:29] <+Dizznasty_> that rush was a huge mistake
[16:00:40] <Timmy_Tryhard> it lost them the QF
[16:00:45] <kappask1> LUL
[16:00:46] <youwizard> He is so impactful this tourney and even igl in last map against SK...
[16:00:51] <Timmy_Tryhard> maybe even the whole tournament ^^
[16:01:15] <+Dizznasty_> retrospectively, yup
[16:01:19] <Timmy_Tryhard> YooWizard didnt watch it fully, but he didnt play well throughout the tourney, maybe vs SK i dont know, but the other games was like "meh"
[16:01:56] <+Dizznasty_> apex was definitely nutt-y! PogCHamp
[16:01:56] <Timmy_Tryhard> Dizznasty_ well, yeah, but... who does that, we're not talking silver/GN here XD
[16:02:12] <maceedolucas> Who won it?
[16:02:18] <+Dizznasty_> true lol
[16:02:19] <Timmy_Tryhard> Dizznasty_ one could say he reached his... peak Kappa

[16:37:02] <youwizard> uhm... they actually won...
[16:37:03] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow well, hate to break it to you, but g2 won the whole tournament ^^
[16:37:27] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow i gues your BR since ur fanboying SK ^^
[16:37:33] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 ohhh miracle
[16:37:39] <Timmy_Tryhard> you're* and guess* XD
[16:38:01] <youwizard> and they even won on mirage which they barely play....
[16:39:01] <Timmy_Tryhard> YooWizard this guy is just fanboying, sk won some shit 2017, so its to be expected they having WTJ supps
[16:39:57] <guigtisparrow> Nyere why u so mad? your country don't has a good team in cs, dont cry =)
[16:40:12] <RoseYamato> so annoying for a guy who watched a game score in 2-5 and already said loss
[16:40:16] <guigtisparrow> but, nice rounds by g2
[16:40:18] <NicoTisse> kennyS ‚ô°
[16:40:35] <guigtisparrow> @RoseYamato Its true hahaha
[16:40:35] <andersonmtomasi> taco ‚ù§
[16:40:37] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow im swedish... ever heard of NIP or Fnatic? :')
[16:41:02] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow or maybe the REAL SK? :')
[16:41:11] <youwizard> SK and Astralis dropped in their form after the major which they qualify while G2 and FaZe have been amazing even though they did not even qualify for the major
[16:41:40] <Timmy_Tryhard> YooWizard i cant wait for faze to get their lineup working man :') its gonna be magic
[16:42:07] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 Yeah, i had heard, are the teams what one time in never they won something hahahah, calm dowm bro, im just kidding with u
[16:42:25] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow only joke here is your english bruh
[16:42:38] <youwizard> NIP and Fnatic are legendary teamsFnatic will probably never win a major again but NIP are starting to have some great results recently
[16:43:01] <Timmy_Tryhard> YooWizard they will never be as good as they were though, sadly, but i have high hopes for them :)
[16:43:46] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow you also know SK used to be swedish players ye? ;P in 1.6?
[16:43:48] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 i know, srry for the bad english hahaha
[16:44:34] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 yep, i know, the actual line up, in the past its been of LG
[16:44:34] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow go study instead of watching cs then :')
[16:44:55] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow boa noite amigo ;)
[16:45:01] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 to play, i dont need english
[16:45:21] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 good night for u too
[16:45:26] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow no, its not like communication is a big thing in cs, not at all :')
[16:45:58] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 to communicate in my server i need portuguese hahaha
[16:46:15] <Timmy_Tryhard> you only get BR's in your queue? :O
[16:46:24] <guigtisparrow> yep
[16:46:37] <Timmy_Tryhard> I mean we get all of europe, so we truly needto speak english
[16:46:42] <youwizard> Definitely not for matchmaking but for competitive teams is a different story
[16:47:01] <guigtisparrow> sometimes some people of argentina/chile and another country of the border
[16:47:03] <Timmy_Tryhard> YooWizard comp is alot about comms too bro :p
[16:47:18] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow do u speak spanish to them then? Kappa
[16:47:54] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 more or less hahaha, they are bad teammates
[16:48:19] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow are they bad because they are from chile? wtf? :S You should just know what europe think of BR's :')
[16:48:32] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 i preffer to not communicate with then hahaha
[16:48:33] <youwizard> thats what i meant...important for pro teams but not that for mm
[16:48:57] <Timmy_Tryhard> YooWizard communication is key in CS, no matter what level u play imho :p
[16:49:00] <youwizard> that is unless you queue together
[16:49:05] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 yeah i know, but had times, they start to griefing just for nothing
[16:49:12] <Timmy_Tryhard> at least im having a hard time when my team is silent :P
[16:49:33] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow maybe because ur being racist? i would consider that a pretty good reason x)
[16:49:51] <youwizard> same here BibleThump BibleThump so annoying when team8s have no mics
[16:50:05] <Timmy_Tryhard> YooWizard where u from btw? :p
[16:50:16] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 I know, the br community is badly seen for the world, with reason
[16:51:07] <Timmy_Tryhard> Guigtisparrow dont let a few judge a whole country ;)
[16:51:10] <youwizard> Oh im from Singapore. Asian CS is trash anyways but it didnt really matter since i support G2 :P
[16:51:24] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 no man, seriously, one game, i open my mic one or two times in the game, had 4 guys of the neighor country, and the guy started griefing
[16:51:58] <Timmy_Tryhard> YooWizard is there even any asian cs? XD i mean, is there any pros from asia? :O
[16:52:01] <guigtisparrow> @Nyere88 yeah, i know, had good persons and bad in every server/country
[16:52:18] <Timmy_Tryhard> not considering KZ then @YooWizard

[21:48:43] <nuutaan> Oh really? I'll have to check out your teams sometime
[21:49:30] <EpicGCN1007> but the problem i dont watch dota

[1 day, 1:42:39] <+akuji_the_heartless> why is immortals listed as brazilian team?
[1 day, 1:43:18] <BatmanCotoco> wtf this question
[1 day, 1:43:20] <diabound__2> shut up kid
[1 day, 1:43:43] <+akuji_the_heartless> Immortals is an American org though
[1 day, 1:44:37] <BatmanCotoco> brazil stay in america

[1 day, 1:46:05] <+flickerzz94> diabound, you are very mature.
[1 day, 1:46:29] <stolpen123> hes probably 11 and russian so.....
[1 day, 1:46:48] <+akuji_the_heartless> I know the players are brazilian. But why is the org than brazilian. If Real Madrid buys ten german players, are they now considered a german football team?
[1 day, 1:47:22] <BatmanCotoco> wtf this logic
[1 day, 1:47:41] <stolpen123> i guess the org is brazilian cuz it was created in brazil?
[1 day, 1:48:11] <idQazaq> Gambit is UK org, but 4 players are from KZ, so they use KZ flag
[1 day, 1:48:17] <+akuji_the_heartless> Immortals was founded by NOah in the US
[1 day, 1:48:47] <stolpen123> oh well i dont know shit about immortals than
[1 day, 1:49:06] <+akuji_the_heartless> I mean it doesn't really matter, just something I noticed
[1 day, 1:49:39] <luizinhozyx3> SK is german org, but all players are br, so they use br flag
[1 day, 1:49:51] <stolpen123> the immortals players are idiots except steel n boltz
[1 day, 1:50:08] <luizinhozyx3> Real
[1 day, 1:50:25] <+akuji_the_heartless> @luizinhozyx3 Alright, I understand why they do it. I don't agree with it but oh well
[1 day, 1:51:07] <+akuji_the_heartless> I like Immortals, at least in LoL they manage their team really good

[1 day, 6:42:51] <+thehollowaytape> crisp, clean lock
[1 day, 6:43:18] <2akcf79> whos aimlock ?
[1 day, 6:43:55] <r3g3ll4put3r3> Hobbit they say ;)
[1 day, 6:44:14] <2akcf79> they all cheat anyway its just the most can hide it better :D
[1 day, 6:44:18] <+thehollowaytape> Dosia
[1 day, 6:44:36] <2akcf79> even konfig did somtimes lock through wall on head
[1 day, 6:44:52] <+thehollowaytape> It's just coincidence
[1 day, 6:45:19] <+thehollowaytape> I have watched my replays and I've stopped on peoples heads through the wall just checking corners
[1 day, 6:45:19] <2akcf79> i think all older peopel have aimlock on beaucsse its les painfull when they got banned they anyway at the end of her carrer
[1 day, 6:45:39] <2akcf79> at least if i have team with 5 player 1 is 30 i would give him the hack he would anway max play 1-2 years more
[1 day, 6:46:03] <2akcf79> na not head on corner i talk about head on wall that have no hole :D
[1 day, 6:46:22] <2akcf79> like through a whole builing where you cant wallbang
[1 day, 6:46:53] <2akcf79> its usualy an accident beacuse the aimbot take the nearest target
[1 day, 6:47:05] <2akcf79> somtimes you aim on somthign trhough a wall where you never would aim
[1 day, 6:47:23] <2akcf79> its anyway stupid to make the aimbot have so high sensivitivity
[1 day, 6:47:42] <AatuLive> nice essay, i'll give you a C
[1 day, 6:48:09] <neotakedown12> mmm a d
[1 day, 6:48:25] <AatuLive> sounds more reasonable, you're right
[1 day, 6:48:41] <+Lieutenant_Zephyr> D+?
[1 day, 6:48:48] <2akcf79> i just hacked and cheate myself you know how cheat works if you cheat yourself its just boring on a long term
[1 day, 6:49:06] <2akcf79> to be honest its more intressting without hack
[1 day, 6:49:13] <+Lieutenant_Zephyr> then why do it if it is boring?
[1 day, 6:49:51] <2akcf79> because i try to cheat in every game to know what is possible what is not possible so i can better say "thats possible / thats a hacker"
[1 day, 6:50:05] <+Lieutenant_Zephyr> ah
[1 day, 6:50:24] <2akcf79> before i buy/play a game what is online i check how much is possible thats why i buyed for example overwatch
[1 day, 6:50:39] <2akcf79> overwatch have some aimbots but its tons less then cs
[1 day, 6:51:01] <2akcf79> and most overwatch aimbots cost 30-60$ a month to behones i dont care if somone cheats who pays so much
[1 day, 6:51:26] <+wicked_black> sounds like you waste alot of time trying to chear
[1 day, 6:51:37] <+wicked_black> cheat
[1 day, 6:51:42] <Gunngun> @2akcf79 yeah sound pretty pathetic
[1 day, 6:51:53] <2akcf79> na usualy i spend maybe 1-2 hours
[1 day, 6:52:06] <2akcf79> somtimes i not even try it out
[1 day, 6:52:13] <Gunngun> why would you?
[1 day, 6:52:20] <2akcf79> just go on russian hacker sites then you isntant see which games are poisoned
[1 day, 6:52:39] <Gunngun> russian what?
[1 day, 6:52:52] <2akcf79> if you older you dont like waste on games that are investet
[1 day, 6:53:14] <2akcf79> russian cheater / coder / hacker sites they usually code stuff for games too
[1 day, 6:53:15] <+wicked_black> thats not true at all, you invest in games you enjoy
[1 day, 6:53:45] <2akcf79> @wicked_black true but if you play lot against hacker you loos fun in that games thats very sad
[1 day, 6:53:52] <+wicked_black> you act like you are some pioneer to the cheating world
[1 day, 6:54:07] <2akcf79> nope just googel
[1 day, 6:54:25] <2akcf79> i have no knowledge about anything but if you find 2-3 sites you know similiar like me
[1 day, 6:54:44] <+Lieutenant_Zephyr> what is the English language
[1 day, 6:55:03] <2akcf79> you mean english site ?
[1 day, 6:55:04] <MRSMILES__> xD
[1 day, 6:55:13] <2akcf79> i think i cant share it here would be bad idea
[1 day, 6:55:19] <+Lieutenant_Zephyr> lmao no bro

[1 day, 7:01:46] <+Lieutenant_Zephyr> yeah they demolish liquid :/
[1 day, 7:02:07] <hennynation> lmao faze... please uninstall
[1 day, 7:02:39] <AatuLive> faze is pretty new to cs
[1 day, 7:03:24] <summoneiro> FaZe is new team name but with well known players
[1 day, 7:05:10] <hennynation> up and coming teams that you should be looking at is liquid and gambit
[1 day, 7:06:14] <hennynation> yes i know this is a rerun. im talking about other tournaments
[1 day, 7:06:26] <2akcf79> the itnressting part is gambit players are all older lik 28-35 or so
[1 day, 7:06:43] <2akcf79> liquid i think is very old team i heard that name like lot years ago but gambit i think was newer to maybe some years ?
[1 day, 7:07:51] <KrablordTTV> gambit is kazakhstan team
[1 day, 7:08:05] <2akcf79> what really haha
[1 day, 7:08:07] <+cancerous_teemo> the fk
[1 day, 7:08:22] <2akcf79> where is borat :D
[1 day, 7:08:22] <KrablordTTV> i know Dosia personally actually - he lives in Russia
[1 day, 7:08:32] <hennynation> liquid has been doing good so far
[1 day, 7:08:47] <2akcf79> are they not in a gameing team house together ?
[1 day, 7:08:50] <KrablordTTV> never thought back in days he would ever go pro cs
[1 day, 7:09:01] <KrablordTTV> he is now in kazakhstan
[1 day, 7:09:21] <hennynation> ^yup
[1 day, 7:09:22] <2akcf79> is the language familiar to kazakhstan ?
[1 day, 7:09:36] <KrablordTTV> pretty much - but most kazahi's know russian
[1 day, 7:09:43] <2akcf79> ah ok then it works well i think was just wondering about language barrier
[1 day, 7:10:21] <2akcf79> last time i heard a leage of legends team 3 korean 2 english somtimes the koreans get so hyped ingame they start talking korean hahaha
[1 day, 7:10:37] <KrablordTTV> LUL
[1 day, 7:10:48] <hennynation> ^ xD
[1 day, 7:10:52] <KrablordTTV> no not like this - ppl in kazakhstan speak russian on daily basis
[1 day, 7:10:59] <hennynation> LOL
[1 day, 7:11:08] <2akcf79> ah ok then i think its fine
[1 day, 7:11:17] <KrablordTTV> cause in Russia its quite alot of them ^_^
[1 day, 7:11:41] <KrablordTTV> they r pretty much asians - but USSR influence left its mark
[1 day, 7:12:14] <KrablordTTV> so for me watching them go for some big tournament - is really strange )
[1 day, 7:13:33] <2akcf79> i was more impressed be the age
[1 day, 7:13:46] <2akcf79> usualy players are super young like 16-24
[1 day, 7:14:30] <KrablordTTV> Dosia is quite old for cs - should be about 30
[1 day, 7:14:33] <2akcf79> this Asa Akira is live again :D
[1 day, 7:14:57] <KrablordTTV> we played 1.6 back in the days - and even then he was older than most of us on server
[1 day, 7:16:12] <2akcf79> jeah but 1.6 i played mostly with friends somtimes or with bots in the 1.6 times t he internet was hourly basis that was super expensive for me it was around 4-7$ per hour
[1 day, 7:16:32] <KrablordTTV> damn - and i thought back in Russia internet sucked
[1 day, 7:16:44] <2akcf79> but it was 1995 or so
[1 day, 7:17:07] <2akcf79> it was very early 65k modem :D the one where you cant use telefon at same time :D

[1 day, 7:17:36] <KrablordTTV> huh - its was hard time to live, forget any electronics, ofcourse pcs and internet are out of question ^_^
[1 day, 7:17:56] <2akcf79> 720 p its just recorded video:D
[1 day, 7:18:05] <KrablordTTV> pagers was quite popular though ^^
[1 day, 7:18:48] <2akcf79> thats why command and conquers and age of empires was much more populair :D
[1 day, 7:19:00] <KrablordTTV> CnC was great series
[1 day, 7:19:05] <almightyduk> !score
[1 day, 7:19:07] <2akcf79> is that france flag or ?
[1 day, 7:19:11] <KrablordTTV> hate EA destroyed it
[1 day, 7:19:35] <2akcf79> i hated it when they stopped adding "you can build walls"
[1 day, 7:20:00] <2akcf79> i foudn the best part to wall your citys ... in some version they deltet all walls cant build anymore ...
[1 day, 7:20:13] <KrablordTTV> i still play red alert 2 sometimes, its still good with native 1080p support and not that bad netcode
[1 day, 7:20:33] <KrablordTTV> got one license for free on origin
[1 day, 7:20:33] <@Moobot> DreamHack Store: http://store.dreamhack.com/?utm_source=twitch_CS&utm_campaign=twitch_panel&utm_medium=twitch
[1 day, 7:20:39] <2akcf79> 1080p was it a rework version ?
[1 day, 7:21:00] <KrablordTTV> nope - just add resolution to config and it will work without a problem
[1 day, 7:21:09] <2akcf79> i tryed age of empires rework version called "HQ" but it sadly not same feeling like the old times :D
[1 day, 7:21:16] <KrablordTTV> its quite small - but you can get used to it
[1 day, 7:21:49] <2akcf79> you have 2k 4k monitor ?
[1 day, 7:21:58] <KrablordTTV> nope just 1080 - 180hz
[1 day, 7:22:08] <KrablordTTV> competitive and shit
[1 day, 7:22:14] <2akcf79> ah ok was just wondeing =)
[1 day, 7:22:35] <2akcf79> jeah got only 1080p too but maybe i buy later a bigger one
[1 day, 7:22:44] <KrablordTTV> what for?)
[1 day, 7:22:52] <2akcf79> i got regular 24" maybe i go for 27 / 30 / 32 version later
[1 day, 7:23:05] <Lujje20> g2 will wim
[1 day, 7:23:13] <2akcf79> somtiems i find 24" super small when i try to work in software :D
[1 day, 7:23:25] <2akcf79> @Lujje20 thanks somone was allready saying it :D
[1 day, 7:23:38] <KrablordTTV> for video and stuff 1440p is quite usable on about 27 inch
[1 day, 7:23:52] <KrablordTTV> but for competitive games its hard
[1 day, 7:24:08] <2akcf79> true more fps / hz is better
[1 day, 7:24:16] <KrablordTTV> and size
[1 day, 7:24:29] <KrablordTTV> hard to concentrate on 27 or higher
[1 day, 7:24:58] <2akcf79> thats right thats why i maybe just buy 2nd 24" so i got 2 same size that works too
[1 day, 7:25:15] <KrablordTTV> if u have 144hz atleast - then yeah
[1 day, 7:25:33] <KrablordTTV> if not - then get something little bit better )
[1 day, 7:26:07] <GreekDudesRPG> hello
[1 day, 7:26:13] <2akcf79> not sure how much mine have
[1 day, 7:26:27] <KrablordTTV> just watch windows settings or google model
[1 day, 7:27:37] <2akcf79> sadly mione have only 60hz
[1 day, 7:27:58] <GreekDudesRPG> ŒíŒõŒëŒßŒëŒ°Œë
[1 day, 7:28:06] <KrablordTTV> then its better to upgrade to something like 144-180 24 or 1440p 144
[1 day, 7:28:14] <2akcf79> BenQ GL2450HT, LED-Monitor - it was very well priced the time i buyed it
[1 day, 7:28:21] <GreekDudesRPG> ŒíŒõŒëŒßŒëŒùŒ§ŒïŒ°Œü ŒíŒõŒëŒßŒôŒîŒôŒü

[1 day, 8:08:14] <2akcf79> T and CT
[1 day, 8:08:34] <xpandcsgo> dust 2 is pretty balanced
[1 day, 8:09:01] <2akcf79> why they dont play dust 2 in tournaments never saw it
[1 day, 8:09:03] <skandig> but they dont play dust 2 now
[1 day, 8:09:15] <KrablordTTV> just cant play stupid dust for 20 years straight
[1 day, 8:09:17] <Poux3> not in active map pool tho
[1 day, 8:09:19] <2akcf79> why not what happen ?
[1 day, 8:09:27] <Poux3> rework
[1 day, 8:09:31] <KrablordTTV> viewers are not happy with it
[1 day, 8:09:44] <KrablordTTV> games are boring and expected
[1 day, 8:09:46] <2akcf79> if i played CS i just played all the time dust 1 and 2 i enjoyed this maps the most D:
[1 day, 8:09:48] <xpandcsgo> it'll be back in the map pool soon it will replace like cobble or some shit
[1 day, 8:09:48] <@Moobot> Follow DreamHack on twitter.com/dreamhackcsgo - facebook.com/DreamHackCSGO - instagram.com/dreamhack - snapchat.com/add/dreamhacklive
[1 day, 8:09:55] <skandig> i think they arer going to make a new dust
[1 day, 8:10:29] <xpandcsgo> @skandig every time theyve taken a map out of the active duty map pool theyve remade it and put it back
[1 day, 8:10:47] <2akcf79> the thing when you play so long no cs that they say RUSH B you have no idea where B is hahah
[1 day, 8:10:47] <skandig> nah, probably cache or overpass. and then those maps are getting reworked
[1 day, 8:10:50] <KrablordTTV> but there is dust2 only map
[1 day, 8:11:05] <skandig> not for pros
[1 day, 8:11:26] <KrablordTTV> its not that tactical - now only reflexes
[1 day, 8:11:41] <KrablordTTV> not much to be invented on map being played so much
[1 day, 8:11:54] <KrablordTTV> if they make it new - then yeah
[1 day, 8:12:28] <KrablordTTV> and as stupid as it sounds whole tournament with dust 2 sounds even worse
[1 day, 8:13:50] <+jrlazie> guy how can i speed up a tradeup contract?
[1 day, 8:14:10] <Mdxceed> bot konfig Kappa
[1 day, 8:15:59] <2akcf79> do they win 2:0 or 2:1 ?
[1 day, 8:16:24] <2akcf79> and why is a final just bo3 ?? was it not allways bo5 for the action at least
[1 day, 8:16:49] <GreekDudesRPG> bo5? there isnt bo4 out yet!
[1 day, 8:17:11] <KrablordTTV> ask dreamhack
[1 day, 8:17:13] <GreekDudesRPG> i expect bo3 be better than bo3
[1 day, 8:17:21] <2akcf79> ok i understand its like 5 hours in the worst cenario but why not ?
[1 day, 8:17:29] <GreekDudesRPG> bo4* be better than bo3
[1 day, 8:17:30] <KrablordTTV> i guess - rent time
[1 day, 8:17:31] <mrlecyborg> bo5 = best of 5
[1 day, 8:17:32] <2akcf79> scenario*
[1 day, 8:17:42] <GreekDudesRPG> oh9

[1 day, 17:24:20] <humaplayz> who thinks nip will win
[1 day, 17:34:53] <Timmy_Tryhard> guardian is silly good man
[1 day, 17:36:24] <srzmon> fallen > guardian > kennys
[1 day, 17:36:46] <cainsprague03> fallen for sure
[1 day, 17:37:05] <cainsprague03> very true
[1 day, 17:37:22] <cainsprague03> kenny pretty overrated in my opinion
[1 day, 17:38:17] <cainsprague03> true
[1 day, 17:38:41] <srzmon> guardian can be always good, but not great like fallen, i think
[1 day, 17:39:29] <cainsprague03> when fallen gains momentum he is unstoppable, just like every player
[1 day, 17:40:15] <srzmon> just like every player... ok kkk
[1 day, 17:41:07] <cainsprague03> i dont think i saw that game
[1 day, 17:41:47] <Timmy_Tryhard> wow... rly bro, thats messed up xD
[1 day, 17:41:59] <Timmy_Tryhard> got timed because i wrote too long of a message
[1 day, 17:42:16] <srzmon> sk it's not a good time
[1 day, 17:42:24] <+Jubmania> Well, get ready to type it all again
[1 day, 17:42:29] <Timmy_Tryhard> cainsprague03 you think you could beat any pro in 1v1 just because u had awp/rifle and they had pistol?
[1 day, 17:42:54] <Timmy_Tryhard> Jubmania had to rephrase it x)
[1 day, 17:43:30] <Timmy_Tryhard> i was like "wtf is that aimpunch" then i realized this isnt live Kappa
[1 day, 17:44:16] <WrigLEy_yoW> nt
[1 day, 17:44:29] <srzmon> guardian can be always good, but the insane plays for fallen beat this pattern
[1 day, 17:44:54] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon problem is when those "insane plays" doesnt happen, what happens then?
[1 day, 17:45:07] <Timmy_Tryhard> whereas guardian will hit the shots 95% of the time, in a consistant manner
[1 day, 17:45:23] <Timmy_Tryhard> faze is gonna be super strong in 2018, you heard it here first =)
[1 day, 17:47:00] <srzmon> @Nyere88 he dont need insane plays every match... he pattern its pretty good i think
[1 day, 17:47:12] <srzmon> better than guardian
[1 day, 17:47:39] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon its a 5 man game, it only works out for him when the rest of the team is consistant and doesnt need IGL input all the time
[1 day, 17:47:44] <srzmon> but this really does not matter, all players get bad moments, everyone
[1 day, 17:48:16] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon its not only about having a bad moment, its about how bad you are when you are on your low
[1 day, 17:48:32] <Timmy_Tryhard> didnt some SK guy go like 0-14 last tourney? :P
[1 day, 17:48:50] <srzmon> i dont think so, it's quite the opposite
[1 day, 17:48:57] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon and what happened on inf vs g2? how did he let his players push to their death without info?
[1 day, 17:49:44] <srzmon> when the rest of the team not playing good, it where it appears more
[1 day, 17:49:56] <srzmon> im not talking about the team
[1 day, 17:50:13] <srzmon> only fallen, sk sucks in the moment
[1 day, 17:51:04] <Timmy_Tryhard> sk changed 1 player...
[1 day, 17:51:46] <srzmon> and ?
[1 day, 17:52:08] <Timmy_Tryhard> its still the same team, what are you saying really? :P
[1 day, 17:53:05] <Timmy_Tryhard> you said "when the rest of the team doesnt play good, he does" maybe its correlation? ;)
[1 day, 17:53:15] <srzmon> im not saying anything .. i just say that : fallen better than guardian '-'
[1 day, 17:53:47] <Timmy_Tryhard> as i said, when fallen is on his game, he is better than guardian, the issue is that guardian is always good, maybe not beasting, but always good
[1 day, 17:55:33] <Timmy_Tryhard> lol i cant even call jw a pigface without automod being angry? :(
[1 day, 17:55:36] <srzmon> and sk... well, they mistakes are so stupid, i think when they put the foots the ground, they will go back to normal and be the number 1 for sure
[1 day, 17:56:14] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon have u seen fazed's lineup tho? on paper its sick as... they just need to get communication and synergy down
[1 day, 17:56:28] <srzmon> isnt easy talking about who is better, all them have his moments, all i can say is: coldzera its a monster
[1 day, 17:56:58] <srzmon> yeahh, faze its a great team, for me nikko its a huge beast
[1 day, 17:57:10] <Timmy_Tryhard> coldzera is a beast for sure :P
[1 day, 17:57:37] <Timmy_Tryhard> individual skill is not worth much in a 5v5 game tho, ive seen crazy players get outplayed by synergy and mind
[1 day, 17:57:42] <srzmon> nikko best AK already seen
[1 day, 17:57:55] <Timmy_Tryhard> nikko best deagle world
[1 day, 17:58:15] <srzmon> yeah, coldzera its better than nikko only because he does stuff that anybody can explain
[1 day, 17:58:48] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon may i ask where ur from? :) your english is a bit funny at times, i understand what u mean tho :P
[1 day, 17:59:01] <Timmy_Tryhard> "is better than nikko" and "nobody can explain" ;)
[1 day, 17:59:29] <srzmon> no one *
[1 day, 17:59:42] <Timmy_Tryhard> but yes, coldzera is a REALLY good individual player :)
[1 day, 18:00:09] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon im feeling the BR love from u man ;D haha
[1 day, 18:00:23] <Timmy_Tryhard> algum br?
[1 day, 18:00:39] <vitcs> @Nyere88 SALVE
[1 day, 18:00:50] <Timmy_Tryhard> how can cannons be such a dangerous spot man!? its soooo open :S
[1 day, 18:00:55] <srzmon> maybe, but this does not influence my admiration for fallen
[1 day, 18:01:01] <Timmy_Tryhard> vitcs im not brazilian my brother, im swedish ^^
[1 day, 18:01:20] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon im not saying fallen is bad bro, just inconsistant :P
[1 day, 18:01:35] <srzmon> i dont give a f** for nationality when we talking about skills
[1 day, 18:02:00] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon ofc not, if that was the case i would say NIP is the worlds best ;)
[1 day, 18:02:11] <Timmy_Tryhard> and that JW was the best awper Kappa
[1 day, 18:02:23] <srzmon> hahahaahua Kappa
[1 day, 18:02:56] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon get_right is the best clutcher imho :P
[1 day, 18:03:23] <Timmy_Tryhard> I mean im no pro at this game at all, far from, im just a DMG who likes to spectate pro games and analyze it ;D
[1 day, 18:04:27] <Timmy_Tryhard> when it comes to spray control get_right is unmatched as well
[1 day, 18:04:41] <Nynex123> shut up u imposter
[1 day, 18:04:44] <srzmon> yeah i gotcha u, be a pro is a dream, but its so hard
[1 day, 18:04:49] <+Jubmania> I <3 Friberg
[1 day, 18:05:03] <Timmy_Tryhard> I dont aspire to be pro, at all :) im too old for it anyways haha
[1 day, 18:05:18] <+Jubmania> Too old? Meh
[1 day, 18:05:36] <+Jubmania> Not till you get really up there in age does your reaction speed just tank
[1 day, 18:05:38] <Nynex123> ZOBRIST IS ALMOST 40
[1 day, 18:06:40] <Timmy_Tryhard> Jubmania uhh could u rephrase that? i might be tired but that made no sense to me XD
[1 day, 18:06:46] <srzmon> yeah but, its not for anyone, u know what a mean ?
[1 day, 18:07:07] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon its not for everyone u mean? XD
[1 day, 18:07:21] <Timmy_Tryhard> rip nip :\
[1 day, 18:07:32] <+Jubmania> It's not until you get really up there in age that your reaction speed really goes into the shitter. Age shouldn't matter otherwise...cept maybe arthritis
[1 day, 18:07:34] <Timmy_Tryhard> pyth ugh!
[1 day, 18:07:38] <srzmon> yeahh, sry dude, i dont know the rules
[1 day, 18:08:08] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon its ok bro =) just correcting you for you to learn, not to be a douche u know

[1 day, 18:08:38] <+Jubmania> No one cares if you're old, so long as you've got some great skills
[1 day, 18:08:54] <srzmon> @Nyere88 what is your patent my friend
[1 day, 18:09:14] <Timmy_Tryhard> Jubmania look at the older players, they have the brains but no longer the reactions :P
[1 day, 18:09:16] <srzmon> living a rerun @kenhax
[1 day, 18:09:27] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon patent? :P what u mean? ^^
[1 day, 18:09:33] <+Jubmania> Then all you gotta do is just practice
[1 day, 18:09:47] <+Jubmania> Age shouldn't stop ya
[1 day, 18:10:04] <Timmy_Tryhard> Jubmania yeah i have some physical conditions that prohibit that :P but thansk for the confidence ;)

[1 day, 18:10:34] <srzmon> @Nyere88 i dont know how u guys call this, i talking like - Eagle or Global
[1 day, 18:10:39] <+Jubmania> Coolio
[1 day, 18:10:50] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon oh my rank? :) im DMG (big star) ;) haha
[1 day, 18:11:32] <Timmy_Tryhard> highest i've been was LEM tho (eagle with oats)
[1 day, 18:11:52] <Timmy_Tryhard> but tbh, i got so carried then so it doesnt count, my highest deserved rank is DMG =)
[1 day, 18:12:18] <srzmon> @Nyere88 yeah this, when u say DMG ... = ?
[1 day, 18:12:32] <srzmon> big star is sheriff ?
[1 day, 18:12:41] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon distuingished master guardian :) yes sheriff ^^
[1 day, 18:13:21] <srzmon> oh nice nice
[1 day, 18:13:53] <srzmon> i buy the game like a year or more, and i have just 500 hours in game
[1 day, 18:14:06] <Timmy_Tryhard> whats ur rank then? :)
[1 day, 18:14:20] <Timmy_Tryhard> i get outaimed by 500hr players, feels so bad
[1 day, 18:14:38] <srzmon> its like a 150 hours for two weeks and o stop playing for mounths
[1 day, 18:14:52] <srzmon> i*
[1 day, 18:15:38] <Timmy_Tryhard> you need to play every week ^^ as with all skills it needs to be maintained
[1 day, 18:16:09] <srzmon> im playing only on gamersclub now, my rank in mm is AK 2, but in gamersclub its like a master guardian elite
[1 day, 18:16:28] <Timmy_Tryhard> what is gamersclub? like esea and faceit? :P
[1 day, 18:16:45] <srzmon> yep
[1 day, 18:17:18] <Timmy_Tryhard> "tottieeeeee" haha
[1 day, 18:17:22] <srzmon> the real problem is that i havent a good psychological
[1 day, 18:17:50] <Timmy_Tryhard> do you mean you cant read the enemies? or do you mean you tilt easily?
[1 day, 18:18:09] <Timmy_Tryhard> if you missread your enemies, go back and watch replays and see what made u missread them :)
[1 day, 18:18:13] <srzmon> tilt easyly kkkkk
[1 day, 18:18:34] <srzmon> i have a good notion of game i think
[1 day, 18:19:01] <Timmy_Tryhard> untilting is nothing you can be taught, its all about how you handle yourself in bad moments
[1 day, 18:19:06] <srzmon> the problem is my position, and sometimes my bullets do not fit, and i stop playing
[1 day, 18:19:33] <Timmy_Tryhard> Analyze your own gameplay, see where u make the biggest mistakes :P
[1 day, 18:19:55] <Timmy_Tryhard> go play community servers (hs only for example) or train spray control on workshop maps
[1 day, 18:20:59] <srzmon> yeah i know, deathmatchs helps alot, but is tilting too, i just have to shut the f* up and play
[1 day, 18:21:00] <@Moobot> DreamHack Store: http://store.dreamhack.com/?utm_source=twitch_CS&utm_campaign=twitch_panel&utm_medium=twitch
[1 day, 18:21:18] <srzmon> thank u bro, u are a nice guy
[1 day, 18:21:24] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon if you get mad, and get tilted, make sure not to tilt the rest of your team :)
[1 day, 18:21:38] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon obrigado hermano ;)
[1 day, 18:21:41] <srzmon> for sure, i dont do that
[1 day, 18:22:19] <Timmy_Tryhard> I mostly get tilted by teammates doing stupid stuff, really...
[1 day, 18:22:33] <Timmy_Tryhard> I dont realize my own mistakes until i see them afterwards in the replay :P
[1 day, 18:23:05] <srzmon> kkkkk
[1 day, 18:23:32] <Timmy_Tryhard> srzmon alot of lower ranked players lack smoke knowledge etc, try to learn 2 smokes on every map =)
[1 day, 18:23:38] <srzmon> u right man
[1 day, 18:24:14] <srzmon> yeah i know, but in my opnion, i have to click before learn the other stuffs u know
[1 day, 18:24:33] <Timmy_Tryhard> you have to click? what u mean with that? =)
[1 day, 18:25:10] <Timmy_Tryhard> Duncan, best analyzer <3
[1 day, 18:25:18] <srzmon> its like, kill everyone, dont lose a 1x1 situation, good spray, good headshots
[1 day, 18:25:35] <srzmon> put bullets on his heads
[1 day, 18:25:44] <Timmy_Tryhard> Well, sometimes outaiming people isnt the win, sometimes mindgaming people is the win
[1 day, 18:25:52] <srzmon> sry for the stupid english bro
