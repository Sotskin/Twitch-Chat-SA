[10:33:02] <+TCG_Sean> i yhought c9 wo
[10:33:04] <hilmir9203> !uptime
[10:33:04] <@Moobot> @hilmir9203 Uptime is: 10h 33m 13s
[10:33:15] <+Ryse_Shadow> this isn't the Boston Major
[10:33:24] <TheStampedeTMG> It was pretty close if I remember right, never would‚Äôve thought C9 could match up with this Faze lineup. Funny how they seemed to level WAY up as soon as Logitech dropped their sponsorship and they were able to use the mice they actually like
[10:33:24] <hilmir9203> This was on 2017
[10:33:27] <zer00rx> !comands
[10:33:29] <+TCG_Sean> i know
[10:33:30] <+Ryse_Shadow> this is from ESL New York 2017 (September)
[10:33:43] <+TCG_Sean> ok thanks
[10:34:31] <TheStampedeTMG> Tarik is the only player that actually LIKES a Logitech mouse but it‚Äôs a really old one, G400s
[10:34:52] <TheStampedeTMG> If I remember right when they won Boston they were all using Zowie while Tarik used the 400s
[10:35:10] <TheStampedeTMG> Logitech confirmed shitty mice Kappa
[10:36:50] <TheStampedeTMG> So many pros use Zowie mice but man they need to fix the switches and side buttons, feels like quality from the mid to late 2000s
