[2:43:31] <notanarc0> thats what they feel comfortable with
[2:43:46] <notanarc0> every team is different
[2:43:52] <Archad0n> but c9 should have awp
[2:44:10] <Archad0n> is it because their team doesnt have a decent awper?
[2:44:27] <notanarc0> no, they're just really good with ak's
[2:44:30] <Archad0n> oh skadoodle has awp now

[16:07:52] <+Masomqwwq> Eh should have expected it with fazes record on inferno
[16:08:21] <+Masomqwwq> wait I can do basic math
[16:08:43] <lollmyer> @masomqwwq prove it
[16:08:57] <+Masomqwwq> this is a semi final, liquid has never made it to a final. And they are the gods of choking and they are in the lead
[16:09:46] <+Masomqwwq> So I guess I can anwser my own question
[16:10:11] <+Masomqwwq> Nitro is from my home town so I have to cheer liquid but sometimes its depressing
[16:12:18] <+Masomqwwq> wait no liquid did make it to the finals
[16:12:20] <CMcr0n1k> @Masomqwwq liquid wins
[16:12:31] <+Masomqwwq> damn ive been out of the scene for a whole
[16:12:32] <CMcr0n1k> lol

[16:14:09] <+Masomqwwq> I dunno last time I kept up with the scene liquid was the worst of the best, consistent attendance for major events but whenever it looked like they were going to deliver they choke
[16:16:14] <CMcr0n1k> they were ranked 4th this year
[16:16:31] <CMcr0n1k> took a trophy home

[23:00:10] <PurpIeYoshi> i mean yesterday he had like 500k viewers but still lmao people saying this is a dead game are dumb
[23:00:23] <PurpIeYoshi> aint dead.. YET trust
[23:00:37] <jamrahhd> i dont think cs will ever die
[23:01:43] <PurpIeYoshi> probably will have a new game after
[23:02:11] <+JJMRTN> I love reruns for the chill chat
[23:02:20] <mrkazandibiv2> sa
[23:02:22] <+JJMRTN> What happened to normal chat in cs events :/
[23:02:34] <PurpIeYoshi> idk people are crazy nowadays
[23:02:41] <+JJMRTN> Yea feelsbadman
[23:02:56] <+JJMRTN> Who will win dh astralis or navi ? ;)
[23:03:28] <PurpIeYoshi> astralis 2-1
[23:03:43] <+JJMRTN> Good guess
[23:03:58] <4musedtv> ;)
[23:04:03] <+JJMRTN> I would watch out for electronic and simple obv if they go off navi might be able to make it
[23:04:18] <wegidshills> I’m voting for navi but I think astralis will win it
[23:04:20] <PurpIeYoshi> first map overpass second map cache or mirage third decider will be train pretty sure
[23:04:31] <+JJMRTN> Will never forgett how much zeus sucked in the star series final so sad
[23:04:51] <PurpIeYoshi> i mean they cant carry the whole weight of the team, astralis all their players are insane
[23:09:21] <PurpIeYoshi> game is starting in about 15 to 30 mins
