[7:05:49] <CayteaCrisis> Hah! MongolZ are getting killed xD
[7:06:02] <CayteaCrisis> Have plenty of rounds to come back though
[7:07:04] <+fRaN_tiK> succ
[7:07:30] <CayteaCrisis> Hopefully, Envy can stop their come back
[7:08:36] <MrT4ngo> wtf
[7:08:50] <CayteaCrisis> ?
[7:10:08] <woombae> damn
[7:11:59] <CayteaCrisis> 7 points behind, need up to the 29th round to make a comeback
[7:16:06] <thechalks> Yeet
[7:18:57] <+Titan177> le tank
[7:19:08] <+Titan177> are all the viewers rn bots or sum shit
[7:19:27] <+noixiousxv> you're a bot
[7:19:37] <+Wuccus242> lmao mongolz with the come back?
[7:20:22] <CayteaCrisis> Only four points behind with three rounds left
[7:20:53] <CayteaCrisis> Make that three points
[7:21:25] <+Falke930> you know, that this is a rerun and envy won
[7:21:51] <CayteaCrisis> You have to ruin it for everyone don't you, Falke.
[7:22:00] <Armory_6> Yep
[7:22:11] <+Titan177> exactly
[7:22:12] <+Falke930> no, just for you
[7:22:19] <CayteaCrisis> Plus, we can kinda see that with the way there's only two rounds and three points between
[7:22:22] <Armory_6> gg envy
[7:22:35] <+noixiousxv> it would be fairly bad if Envy didn't beat MongolZ
[7:22:40] <+Falke930> its 3 rounds and 3 points ...
[7:22:54] <CayteaCrisis> 28/30
[7:23:03] <Armory_6> yepper. but envy isnt anywhere near as good as they used to be.
[7:23:08] <+Falke930> 28, 29 30 thats 3
[7:23:27] <CayteaCrisis> Some people don't count the current round
[7:23:42] <CayteaCrisis> It's being played
[7:23:49] <+Falke930> but its still a running round that they could win
[7:23:52] <CayteaCrisis> Thus, until the end, you don't count it
[7:24:22] <+ToasterBro69> mm cake
[7:24:35] <CayteaCrisis> It's macaroon...
