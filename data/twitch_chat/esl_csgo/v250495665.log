[2:42:05] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> that last game was a decent match
[2:42:17] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> and chief made aussie Cs seem decent
[2:42:17] <zclanc> @nisatheslayer because is so funny
[2:42:24] <69cmonbruh69> GRAYHOUND is better without Burn
[2:42:30] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> but this game aussie Cs just looks tragic again
[2:42:45] <diegoleonel9> Ez
[2:42:52] <NisaTheSlayer> @zclanc i mean troll him about what? he lost or messed up or something. of course i know trolling is funny hahaha
[2:42:56] <llamas_cs> well it's a div 2 Aussie team vs div 1 of course it won't look good

[2:45:13] <VeeLovesMusic> These are mistakes that i do while playing this game ... are these people considered "pro" ?
[2:45:14] <CorgsCSGO> wtf
[2:45:16] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> to make this emotional
[2:45:17] <$smolboyjuju> @ManicMunday yeah exactly. still really hoping tm make it, but thatd be a huge upset to order
[2:45:24] <mqk51896> why is this streamed on twitch? i thought all esl games were on facebook now?
[2:45:28] <NisaTheSlayer> @zclanc i see. will join his channel and probably start trolling him too then.
[2:45:45] <ManicMunday> @smolboyjuju chiefs just did tho, it is possible
[2:45:47] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> @mqk51896 who tf uses Facebook anymore
[2:45:52] <MasterTrey1414> Lol
[2:46:02] <mqk51896> @mmmaiamm_akademon that's the point, esl has a contract with facebook to stream their matches
[2:46:04] <Kitty_Stinky> What’s Facebook?
[2:46:08] <zclanc> @nisatheslayer 95% of his stream donates r troll donates
[2:46:14] <mqk51896> so why is this one streamed on twitch
[2:46:25] <$smolboyjuju> @ManicMunday dont so much mean the matcup, we've beaten them before, but to not get in to iem sydney. thatd be the upset
[2:46:27] <mqk51896> im not complaining, just curious
[2:46:30] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> clearly ESL don't give a fk
[2:46:40] <MasterTrey1414> Bc twitch is better
[2:46:44] <+VanDrack011104> I'm happy it is streamed on Twitch because I never use facebook.
[2:46:51] <$smolboyjuju> @mqk51896 that was for pro league afaik
[2:46:52] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> how are they going to get views on Facebook
[2:46:57] <llamas_cs> esl pro league isn't all of esl

[2:48:50] <$smolboyjuju> yeah im just hoping its a good match either way
[2:48:59] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> why did they even do a contract with Facebook
[2:49:05] <zclanc> @nisatheslayer sometimes he laugh, sometimes he dont give af and sometimes he just pray for this stop
[2:49:08] <Kitty_Stinky> Money
[2:49:09] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> that's just a bad deal in the long run
[2:49:20] <Pivel_> zucc prob givem the buccs
[2:49:35] <Kitty_Stinky> Zucc paid more than amazon
[2:49:40] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> that's fast cash for now but a huge loss I'm the long run ESL has a bad marketing team
