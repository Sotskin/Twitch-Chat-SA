[1:02:01] <kirsonity> 8-7 Consp
[1:02:30] <dissonantdreams> was there any p90 use in pro tournaments?
[1:02:44] <skiffle21> p90x?
[1:02:49] <PhilipFillop> from nip no doubt
[1:02:50] <ucangacan> pro's dont choose p90
[1:03:02] <+Clivefrog> it's called pro90 for a reason
[1:03:52] <+116RingWraith> p90s price doesnt make up for its low damage. not worth it in competitive economy
[1:04:17] <Dxterity> 1700 for a live major grand final? pathetic.
[1:04:19] <+Clivefrog> must be cold in the studio
[1:04:44] <+116RingWraith> both galil and famas are lower in price than the p90, no point choosing it over them
[1:05:00] <Mareeco> How Win?
[1:05:12] <+116RingWraith> half time
[1:05:22] <dissonantdreams> I mean p90 can be used in a crazy rush on cobble blong, then you could steal the ct weapons

[1:05:32] <+johnballhand> @Clivefrog had to point them out BibleThump

[1:05:55] <TenWolfik> hello
[1:05:55] <+116RingWraith> which is 1300 cheaper (;
[1:06:23] <dissonantdreams> true, i mean pros are way better at hitting heads
[1:06:49] <+116RingWraith> yup.
[1:07:22] <+johnballhand> if head_shot == efficient:
[1:08:04] <+116RingWraith> i mean if you can hit the hs its more efficient 999/1000
[1:08:33] <+116RingWraith> 1/10 being on office if their head is behind the garage door as it goes up and their body is exposed (;

[1:12:08] <+MorningScout> hold W > tactical play
[1:12:17] <Soviet_666> ^
[1:12:21] <+johnballhand> when money matters a lot mac and ump are far better choices
[1:12:23] <Abyssor> capitch a what
[1:12:31] <+johnballhand> considering for 350 more you get an ak over a p90
[1:12:42] <+Clivefrog> their A defense is horrible
[1:12:46] <+116RingWraith> when money doesnt matter there is literally no point to get p90 :p
[1:13:03] <kroja2204> second half: rush rush rush
[1:13:13] <Joseph_Gaertner> idek these teams
[1:13:14] <skiffle21> So there is never a point o buy a p90?
[1:13:20] <+johnballhand> if you want to run into armoured targets and hold down left click maybe its worth
[1:13:24] <dissonantdreams> i miss the overpowered ump
[1:13:30] <+116RingWraith> pretty much. @skiffle21
[1:13:32] <Soviet_666> never buy the p90
[1:13:38] <duke1234> this is better game than surge vs gh
[1:13:40] <+johnballhand> but that situation is possibly 5/1000 situations
[1:13:42] <skiffle21> haha got it
[1:13:52] <dissonantdreams> i used to be able to master the p90 spray, but now i cant kill anyone with it
[1:13:56] <+116RingWraith> @johnballhand that means you most likely will not be in a position to be traded by your teammates
[1:14:51] <catris> ez flicks
[1:14:59] <+johnballhand> @116RingWraith i know im saying its a fucking terrible choice

[1:17:50] <dissonantdreams> that's true, but i find myself much more likely to die using nova or the mag
[1:17:50] <+116RingWraith> firing rate is not very good.
[1:17:58] <Alezja_3> AU CS
[1:18:07] <dissonantdreams> delay is too much if you fail to kill in one shot
[1:18:08] <siberukus> ffs karath its ay-rez and air-rees you aren't that dumb
[1:18:08] <+Clivefrog> HSWP
[1:18:08] <+116RingWraith> well you should almost never use a shotty anyways lol..
[1:18:24] <dissonantdreams> i guess thats why im in nova 3 and not wher eyoure at XD
[1:18:41] <+johnballhand> mag>nova>xm>sawnoff imo
[1:18:45] <+116RingWraith> haha i used to use the auto shotty, no worries :p
[1:18:49] <+Clivefrog> nova 3 is pretty 1337
[1:18:49] <dissonantdreams> but i guess it can be used sometimes to surprise your enemies on ct side\
[1:19:09] <oneballmann> depends on your ranks :D
[1:19:10] <dissonantdreams> i used to be mg1 but its pretty heated up there

[1:19:49] <oneballmann> xm is shitty, if i would play a shotgun, than it would be mag7
[1:20:06] <+116RingWraith> the firing rate makes it very luck based against automatic weapons
[1:20:14] <Soviet_666> why can noone get then/than right?
[1:20:16] <dissonantdreams> what if you were on t side?
[1:20:35] <oneballmann> on t side is the mac10
[1:20:39] <+116RingWraith> movement speed doesnt make up for lack of range / ammo
[1:20:44] <dissonantdreams> well xm works against lower level players when they havent mastered spray and crosshair i believe
[1:20:51] <+116RingWraith> yup^
[1:20:54] <oneballmann> Soviet_666 because english no mother language
[1:21:09] <+116RingWraith> @oneballmann Kappa
[1:21:12] <dissonantdreams> ive seen people spend almost 3 whole seconds trying to spray me as i lay in 3 shots of xm
[1:21:13] <Soviet_666> i feel you bb <3
[1:21:13] <+johnballhand> same sort of situation as autosniper vs awp
[1:21:38] <Joseph_Gaertner> overtime?

[2:03:52] <Almightyburge> n0thing jordan gilbert
[2:04:05] <+116RingWraith> 90% of csgo gamers are immature and toxic af
[2:04:06] <Emirhanuner> enerji enerji birazda sinerji
[2:04:24] <+116RingWraith> so you cant necessarily say one nationality is more toxic than any others
[2:04:25] <psYcHic01_1999> the same can be said for the asian equivalents, the pinoys and the indons..

[2:06:14] <+116RingWraith> exactly @Polonium2 people always accuse other nationalities of being toxic, when most the time they themselves are just as IF NOT more toxic :P
[2:06:18] <BasSomers> most games are more toxic than csgo and those games don't even have voice comms
[2:06:35] <lapanbit> ^yup
[2:06:36] <Elfishguy11> What up now Swede woooooo

[2:08:34] <+Duridertru> @Polonium2 what makes you say that?
[2:08:42] <+wy_ch> @mmmaiamm_akademon a bit like our internet
[2:08:47] <BasSomers> there is 0 strategy in this game, they just try to outaim people
[2:08:50] <+116RingWraith> @Polonium2 I have played cod1, i only play csgo these days :P
[2:08:57] <+Duridertru> @BasSomers

[2:09:08] <+Duridertru> @BasSomers you'
[2:09:11] <ohiceaver> @DanielPifferr os cara n√£o tem uma entrada planejada
[2:09:24] <+Duridertru> @BasSomers you've clearly never played the game, especially at high rank
[2:09:35] <BasSomers> sure zuluL
[2:09:41] <+Duridertru> @BasSomers there is an incredible amount of strategy involved, maybe not in silver
[2:09:42] <+DanielPifferr> @ohiceaver ss, parece meus mm
[2:09:51] <Polonium2> @BasSomers you just described casual cs
[2:09:57] <+Duridertru> just because you cant do it doesnt mean its not there
[2:09:57] <BasSomers> @Duridertru I know there is in csgo, I was talking about this game in general lol
[2:10:05] <+116RingWraith> ever played cod1 rifles only search and destroy? pretty much cs without the economy aspect
[2:10:07] <BasSomers> specific*
[2:10:18] <xistow> !sens
[2:10:27] <+Duridertru> oh i just tuned in i had no idea
[2:10:46] <therealshawn12> Ayy LMAO
[2:10:56] <BasSomers> @Duridertru I know strategy is key in this game, don't assume things if you don't have reliable information. I was just saying this game the T sides aren't doing any strat plays, they're just walking in with AK's trying to outaim people.
[2:11:02] <deavski> vac
[2:11:06] <+impulsche> ayyyreeeez
[2:11:07] <+116RingWraith> aim and movement are different yes, but other than that it is pretty close
[2:12:13] <pantherNZ> damn this cs is embarrassing, no map control, no fakes, no proper con control
[2:12:15] <+Duridertru> @BasSomers you do have to agree though you're first statement was pretty broad if i hadnt watched the first half of this game i could only assume you're talking about the game in general
[2:12:25] <BasSomers> That's fair
[2:12:26] <+Duridertru> i see what you'
[2:12:29] <pantherNZ> it's insane, it's juust literally a bunch of aimers running around lol
[2:12:37] <+Duridertru> i see what you are getting at though
[2:12:38] <BasSomers> But look at this round lmfao
[2:12:52] <jonezy1986> dear casters.... shut up unless it‚Äôs relevant you don‚Äôt have to fill every second with words üëå
[2:13:34] <Waton91> why are they never play dust2? i remember i was played a lot in pro gaming back then
[2:13:35] <+116RingWraith> @jonezy1986 just mute the stream?
[2:13:36] <DJsjonno> @jonezy1986 RT
[2:13:49] <BasSomers> @Waton91 dust isn't in map pool anymore
[2:14:07] <@Smites> stympaks you can talk again
[2:14:11] <Waton91> @BasSomers who was deciding what maps are in map pool?
[2:14:25] <+Duridertru> i couldnt imagine a match where the casters just went silent for 30 seconds
[2:14:25] <pantherNZ> valve does
[2:14:26] <Waton91> and what maps are inside?
[2:14:28] <csgocrazy1> fucking taboo noobs
[2:14:30] <BasSomers> idk how map pool is determined, I just know dust2 isn't in it

[3:16:45] <OdeToJoy_By> @CaBlazze when you pull down - you're trying to control the spray
[3:16:47] <Jan1506> 'spray' is actually the opposite of 'tapping'. Spraying is holding fire button. Tapping is tapping your fire button
