[19:02:59] <LetsLukeYT> ok thx
[19:03:38] <LetsLukeYT> kenny is the best player
[19:03:41] <MrLeGeNd43> sup

[19:06:08] <LetsLukeYT> end is 22:19
[19:06:28] <n0b0dycs> G2 is sh*t
[19:06:35] <LetsLukeYT> g2 22 and gambit 19
[19:06:45] <LetsLukeYT> g2 is best
[19:06:55] <MrLeGeNd43> yes they are
[19:07:10] <n0b0dycs> not really, g2´s time is over.
[19:07:30] <LetsLukeYT> nop
[19:07:54] <n0b0dycs> Sure, they haven´t had a good tournament since Dreamhack malmö 2017
[19:08:27] <MrLeGeNd43> thats true
[19:08:34] <Chipacuerito> g2 is so bad, im nova 4 and i could 1v5 them and win if they play like this LOL
[19:08:47] <boudyt> ~you sure xD
[19:08:52] <LetsLukeYT> yeah... because 22 for g2 and gambit 19
[19:09:04] <Chipacuerito> they be am trash
[19:09:17] <LetsLukeYT> or nip is good
[19:09:18] <ancient45> Yo
[19:09:41] <+rikama> Is RERUN CPU or GPU manufacturer
[19:09:42] <MrLeGeNd43> fnatic is better than nip
[19:09:44] <n0b0dycs> Luke, nur weil sie gegen Gambit gewonnen haben sind sie noch lang kein gutes Team, wie gesagt, G2´s Zeiten sind vorbei
[19:09:52] <LetsLukeYT> yoooool wahrscheinlich
[19:09:54] <ancient45> 500 watching a rerun lol
[19:10:26] <n0b0dycs> Luke, wenn du sagst dass G2 jetzt noch ein Top 3/5 Team ist hast du anscheinend keine Ahnung von Esports xD
[19:10:35] <boudyt> most are at school :P
[19:10:38] <MrLeGeNd43> kenny is a legend
[19:10:45] <LetsLukeYT> yeah
[19:11:09] <ancient45> G2 is dead
[19:11:33] <n0b0dycs> @MrLeGeNd43 but his Time is over aswell, he was a god back in 2014, now he is an inconsistent player

[22:11:56] <hellojustalex> monkaS
[22:12:02] <Minatostv> strike*
[22:12:17] <toasterstrodel666> lmfao when the fortnite/pubg kids say it's dead
[22:12:39] <toasterstrodel666> it's the most average fps game i can imagine
[22:12:50] <toasterstrodel666> so it's not going to die
[22:13:26] <RedquAntum1> 2k is back Kappa
[22:14:17] <NextSRB> 1.3 mil ppl watch final match FaZe vs C9 lul dead. Fortnite and PUBG never will have that numbers.
[22:14:38] <toasterstrodel666> idk what's fun about fortnite too, and PUBG is too broken
[22:15:01] <toasterstrodel666> all I see on fortnite is spam clicking a tree and here and there shooting somebody which is like 1/5 the gameplay
[22:16:17] <NextSRB> Pubg has disgusting physics jumping, driving. And bugs too much
[22:16:25] <+kalfe3001> those games are strong because, lets be honest, most people really suck at gaming. I mean 60+% of the MM players in csgo are lower than mg
[22:16:56] <NextSRB> @kalfe3001 true
[22:17:01] <toasterstrodel666> ^ teamplay games are becoming less relevant due to players who think they're too good to be on a team
[22:17:03] <+kalfe3001> and for them a game that is completely random and has very little to do with skill is amazing. Because even with their pathetic lack of skill they can still achieve things without the need of improvement
[22:17:23] <toasterstrodel666> so true omg
[22:18:27] <NextSRB> pubg ,,skill" cant compare with cs go play skills
[22:18:30] <weak2222> Is this live?
[22:18:42] <NextSRB> @weak2222 No, rerun
[22:18:45] <toasterstrodel666> I also see people struggle to use the looting ui in pubg because it's just an entire list, and no @weak2222 it's a rerun
[22:19:05] <toasterstrodel666> the game is too inconvenient for players in almost every way
[22:21:27] <NextSRB> to learn cs go u need some years to play, pubg and fortnite you can learn in 3 month if u play constantly
[22:21:54] <yrkcm> TARIK NABER LAN
[22:22:12] <toasterstrodel666> nah i'd say like, cs you need 3 months of constant playing and training to get into a decent enough rank
[22:22:30] <toasterstrodel666> and in fortnite you need like 1 week to get decent lol
[22:22:51] <NextSRB> to learn shoot, but to learn how to play and how to play maps
[22:23:06] <NextSRB> cant learn in 3 month
[22:23:53] <toasterstrodel666> i think I got good enough at go within 4 months to about 5, but I already knew some of the maps out of 1.6 and source
[22:24:05] <toasterstrodel666> and it really does change a lot with map knowledge and game sense
[22:24:40] <NextSRB> but smokes, moly flash is not same in cs go and 1.6
[22:24:58] <toasterstrodel666> lord no lol
[22:25:41] <toasterstrodel666> grenade physics in hl1 engines are completely different from go's
[22:26:43] <toasterstrodel666> so much different that it's even a separate skill for grenading
[22:26:52] <NextSRB> u have more chance to win if know use smoke correctly
[22:27:51] <toasterstrodel666> all the grenades boost the chance i'd say, even a decoy
[22:28:24] <nevier_> 6 ads wtf
[22:30:52] <NextSRB> if u smoke spots u will have more chance to win

[1 day, 6:17:09] <Skeetley> yeah bodyy is the only one getting kills
[1 day, 6:17:22] <sandenarn1> I have 1000 on optic ez
[1 day, 6:17:50] <Skeetley> mixwell and allu is a pretty powerful AWP duo
[1 day, 6:18:45] <captain1army> I think s1mple is the best awper now so yeah rip kennyS
[1 day, 6:18:55] <makkarakuningas1> or fallen
[1 day, 6:19:22] <Skeetley> yeah id say so too, kennyS just hasnt done as well as he used to. i think its fallen
[1 day, 6:20:13] <Skeetley> s1mple is great but i think fallen is more consistently good while s1mple just gets lucky every now and then
[1 day, 6:20:30] <captain1army> Fallen is a good awper I'm not gonna lie but I think s1mpel is better
[1 day, 6:20:58] <captain1army> *s1mple
[1 day, 6:21:06] <Skeetley> id like to see the two dual each other, i really want to know who the best actually is cause it's all opinion at this point
[1 day, 6:22:17] <Armory_6> I feel like Fallen and s1mple are pretty even. Fallen maybe slightly better
[1 day, 6:22:26] <Skeetley> ive seen guardian be pretty good too but not as good as s1mple or fallen
[1 day, 6:22:30] <makkarakuningas1> but somebodys say that GuardiaN is better than fallen but idk
[1 day, 6:23:05] <Skeetley> its all opinion until they actually fight
[1 day, 6:23:09] <MargiGaming> i think that dev1ce has playd good
[1 day, 6:23:11] <Armory_6> GuardiaN has good clutches from time to time, but he takes awhile to show up
[1 day, 6:23:22] <Skeetley> yeah
[1 day, 6:23:58] <Armory_6> Hey how bout Stew joining SK lol

[1 day, 12:53:15] <Coca_Cola_88Edition> wassup everyone
[1 day, 12:53:23] <+sMawgy> now you cant gamble on games with skins like wtf
[1 day, 12:53:50] <bodadem2> seems fine to me.. although I don't play CS, so what do I know?
[1 day, 12:54:15] <+sMawgy> yeah its a counter to gambling
[1 day, 12:54:34] <+sMawgy> but gambling is how csgo is where it is
[1 day, 12:55:02] <+sMawgy> csgo was dead, skins were introduced and here we are
[1 day, 12:55:31] <bodadem2> to be fair, they probably felt like they had to do something to avoid getting banned in certain countries
[1 day, 12:56:38] <Coca_Cola_88Edition> i WANT that arm band
[1 day, 12:57:01] <+sMawgy> thats the thing tho online gambling is happening no matter what, there's no way of really stopping it, like smoking pot, its illegal, but so many people do it anyway and they have no reason to stop
[1 day, 12:58:11] <bodadem2> but in general children don't have access to online gambling and with cs:go they did
[1 day, 12:59:25] <+Austin_Robinson24> Im not happy abt it but i can see why they did it
[1 day, 13:01:08] <+sMawgy> yeah i see why, but any kid that can find a parents credit card can ganble
[1 day, 13:01:20] <+sMawgy> and to buy skins too you need to use a card
