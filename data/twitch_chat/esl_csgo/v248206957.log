[8:00:45] <sribust> The reruns’ chats are dead as a can of spam. Don’t bother
[8:01:05] <%m4db4stard> There are no rerun chats

[8:01:31] <PandaWithAGun1> Oh didn’t notice this was a rerun
[8:01:41] <%m4db4stard> When it's a rerun stream why would you even bother to chat?
[8:01:42] <RlKoCS> Wat

[9:18:05] <+Jeyseph> Title is cut off on mobile
[9:18:20] <sribust> This chat was better a few minutes ago...
[9:18:33] <+xceebsx> Much agreed @sribust
[9:19:11] <sribust> Lies Guardian is best awper
[9:19:30] <YaNyX3> s1mple is best awper :)
[9:19:58] <+toqqle> it’s kenny but we can have favorites sumVac2
[9:19:58] <+xceebsx> Nah. Nitro Kappa
[9:20:18] <sribust> Faux COD xD
[9:20:45] <+xceebsx> S1mple is trash
[9:21:19] <sribust> This is amazing.
[9:21:24] <+toqqle> Skadoodle is my fav but Kenny is probably the best in history
[9:21:39] <+Eklein99> I miss semmler :(
[9:21:59] <potatomorty> shroud is back
[9:22:14] <+toqqle> it’s a rerun
[9:22:42] <sribust> Rerun is the sponsor, isn’t it
[9:23:08] <+xceebsx> Yes

[9:25:15] <+xceebsx> Rip
[9:25:22] <sribust> 5 OTs, that’s quintuple
[9:25:42] <RaYc0n1> !time
[9:26:10] <+toqqle> i couldn’t imagine playing for 10+ hours for one series like they do sometimes
[9:26:13] <sribust> It’s 4:35
[9:26:30] <+toqqle> especially at that level
[9:28:28] <sribust> I hate commercials.
[9:29:11] <+toqqle> it’s annoying that they play them on reruns for people just wanting to watch good reruns
[9:29:25] <+toqqle> i understand playing them for hundreds of thousands of people
[9:29:33] <aldwyn101> Wow
[9:30:57] <aldwyn101> Wew
[9:31:19] <guldberg1979> @toqqle so right
