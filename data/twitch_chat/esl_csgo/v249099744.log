[0:13:30] <+Now1n> gambling is a sin and a waste of money
[0:13:31] <RealCS2000> I'm thinking 2-1 mvp wins
[0:13:33] <im_rarepepe> i think its gonna be a draw
[0:13:41] <+Now1n> I agree @realcs2000
[0:13:47] <+will1x2> which server ? singapore again ?
[0:14:06] <RealCS2000> china maybe? aint they both central asia
[0:14:12] <TheDauntlessKunt> 2-1 Tyloo close call
[0:14:27] <+Spekky> 0-0 calling it
[0:14:38] <+Spekky> then 2-1 when its over piboTea
[0:14:41] <imposibleyouwin> !maps
[0:14:46] <+will1x2> they should play in china but when flash play 5power, they use singapore server and everyone 75-100 ping.
[0:15:05] <RealCS2000> y tho
