[1:02:28] <Polonium2> thanks! i was thinking of getting Palladin. just needed a second opinion
[1:02:58] <Biggleby> years from now they still be streaming Oakland 2017..... ESL has abandoned this channel for FB. Considering what FB is going through now it must ave been worst business decision ever
[1:03:10] <Daboots2002> no@camogeko worst game
[1:03:14] <Biggleby> from ESL
[1:03:39] <P0WERADEB0NG> @Biggleby was a bad decision regardless
[1:03:40] <$CamoGeko> @Polonium2 honestly its personal preference, but both Paladin and Battlestar are nice skins imo
[1:03:47] <Biggleby> yes
[1:04:41] <P0WERADEB0NG> they obviously are on the reach out to get normies in on the e-sports shit but facebook wont make a slither of difference
[1:05:13] <Daboots2002> @p0weradeb0ng too true
[1:05:19] <Biggleby> if the normies abandon fb then adios muchachos.......
[1:05:27] <$CamoGeko> Selling out to Facebook was the worst decision they made for the Pro League
[1:05:37] <Biggleby> indeed
[1:05:41] <LeonidasPF> Neo Noir
[1:05:48] <Biggleby> I wonder how long their contract with fb is
[1:05:48] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[1:06:07] <$CamoGeko> @Biggleby I think its for the whole season
[1:06:36] <Biggleby> time goes quickly tho, thankfully-. Hope they return to twitch eventually
[1:07:03] <Kalsongmannen123> Kappa
[1:07:25] <LeonidasPF> kappa
[1:07:26] <$CamoGeko> i reckon they will return to Twitch or YouTube for the next season, considering the backlash they've had

[1:08:37] <$CamoGeko> LUL
[1:09:59] <$CamoGeko> I dont get the point of messing about with it or being greedy, if it works dont fix it
[1:10:34] <Rektenwod95> ALL MUST WATCH *** HAIRCUT
[1:12:42] <P0WERADEB0NG> wow i got timed out and deleted for talking CSGO marketing politics? gtfo
[1:12:52] <$CamoGeko> Its stupid though, ESL have such a huge Twitch presence with a channel that has loads of followers. Why alienate them by switching to Facebook where no one gives a shit about CSGO
[1:13:11] <+Darthhorngaming> ^^
[1:13:31] <+Darthhorngaming> If I want to watch games, I go to twitch...not Facebook
[1:13:40] <P0WERADEB0NG> because they ran that 2017 add campaign on facebook and somehow assume the extra 3 million clicks or some shit they got on thier adds was somehow usefull or even truthful data
[1:14:03] <+keepcalmandgetvac> so many ppl haven't account on fb
[1:14:39] <BrOsBiT> F A C E B OMEGALUL OMEGALUL K
[1:15:18] <+Darthhorngaming> I can see restreaming it to Facebook but not doing away with twitch
[1:16:33] <P0WERADEB0NG> @Darthhorngaming they did already, CS:GO, DOTA 2 and some other crap are facebook exclusive streams
[1:16:57] <$CamoGeko> yeah I wouldnt mind if it was just an additional stream, but they sold out completely and went full exclusive!! I mean for the finals okay, but FOR THE WHOLE SEASON??? Makes no sense!!
[1:17:01] <P0WERADEB0NG> they did it last year with youtube now its facebook
[1:17:36] <$CamoGeko> honestly I wouldnt mind as much if it was YouTube Gaming, but Facebook???
[1:18:29] <P0WERADEB0NG> facebook has 360 degree viewer Kappa
[1:20:10] <$CamoGeko> Facebook is also a site thats used by a huge number of single mums

[5:38:47] <picklerickkk_> I’m building a 20 dollar inv so I wanna know, I can’t decide
[5:38:50] <erikkencs> sk is the way
[5:39:02] <casettapefromthe80s> I have spread my knowledge.
[5:39:04] <picklerickkk_> SK for sure
[5:39:09] <TheDrOsiris> @erikkencs Nope, C9 all day
[5:39:26] <TheDrOsiris> @picklerickkk_ Nope, C9 all day.
[5:39:42] <picklerickkk_> Yeah
[5:39:46] <casettapefromthe80s> The Astralis went down hill.
[5:40:34] <casettapefromthe80s> Go figure there getting beaten.
[5:41:13] <picklerickkk_> There’s an ak emerald pinstripe with flipsid3 stickers on the market, worth buying?
[5:41:15] <erikkencs> even stewie went to sk
[5:41:53] <TheDrOsiris> Cloud9 vs SK on Inferno for ECS and Cloud9 still won without Stewie
[5:42:13] <casettapefromthe80s> Proves they're good.
[5:42:35] <erikkencs> 2 majors
[5:43:30] <picklerickkk_> Coordination is more important than aim I think. I played with Mg1 uncordinated, got destroyed. Got a team, went on a 16 win streak over a few days
[5:43:41] <erikkencs> best team of 2k17, team who on more championships in 2k17
[5:43:46] <picklerickkk_> Everyone says it’s about aim only, I don’t get that
[5:44:24] <erikkencs> the only thing that c9 have agains sk is the champ in são paulo
[5:44:31] <imnotfamous4> Precise shots
[5:45:39] <erikkencs> prove me i'm wrong

[6:54:08] <yungdakz> what were those 2 people that ran onto site doing ?? LOL they heard their teammate die from checkered and neither turned
[6:54:25] <TackyCFG> flashed?
[6:54:29] <FLy__Tv> checkered?
[6:55:02] <datphoria0> easy win
[6:55:07] <yungdakz> checkered/checkers
[6:55:17] <+GunHoDaddy> didn't realize how bad MongolZ were losing
[6:55:17] <yungdakz> the hallway in b with the checkered floor pattern
[6:55:46] <FLy__Tv> yes ik what it is lol but its not called checkered
[6:55:59] <yungdakz> yes it is.... checkered or checkers it what it's called lol
[6:56:19] <FLy__Tv> no lol its called checkers XD
[6:56:31] <yungdakz> you're silver
[6:56:39] <FLy__Tv> mad XD
[6:56:43] <yungdakz> shh man lol you have been playing cs for like 2 months
[6:56:56] <FLy__Tv> your so toxic XD
[6:57:06] <yungdakz> it's like on mirage, sniper window is also called snipers/window/nest
[6:57:31] <TackyCFG> ***
[6:57:33] <yungdakz> if you've played cs for longer than a couple months you'd know :P
[6:57:57] <FLy__Tv> yes, thats right but only people who cant spell/ eu idiots call it "checkered"
[6:58:40] <TackyCFG> If you check the comp map callouts on the steamforum they say its called "checkers" @yungdakz
[6:59:02] <TyroGamer0> whens the next tournament
[6:59:03] <FLy__Tv> no one calls it checkered
