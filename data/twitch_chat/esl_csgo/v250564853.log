[0:16:14] <ProBotteD2> rerun from 2k17 XDD woow, why esl
[0:17:39] <ぽけみん> KappaPride
[0:19:18] <koutsoupasss> nice laggy replay
[0:19:39] <@Cent> No lag! It's just you. Koutsoupasss
[0:19:59] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> who remembers when Nip were good
[0:20:23] <Scorge1324> lmao true
[0:20:23] <murilo42O> 1.6
[0:20:52] <monosnubben> FINAL
[0:21:03] <monosnubben> hypeeeeeee
[0:21:05] <koutsoupasss> not now, it happened like 3 min ago
[0:21:42] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> @cent the rerun isn't Laggy only the reply of the game
[0:22:06] <@Cent> <_< I still don't see it. I'll try another browser.
[0:22:10] <koutsoupasss> that replay was laggy too for me
[0:22:38] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> no cent you don't understand the replay showing the round was Laggy not the gameplay it's self
[0:22:46] <TheFailedStrategist> Replay was laggy coz it’s slowed down??
[0:22:51] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> as in the highlight reply
[0:23:15] <koutsoupasss> it's never laggy during "live gameplay", it's only laggy on replays
[0:23:46] <TheFailedStrategist> Yeah highlight replay looks laggy cos it’s slowed down, thus the frames to time makes it looks laggy
[0:24:14] <ProBotteD2> why are they rerunning match from 2017..? ;p
[0:24:37] <TheFailedStrategist> Best tourney btw, cos of who won :p
[0:24:50] <koutsoupasss> @mmmaiamm_akademon i dont know about that, isn't it supposed to be a huge production and stuff?
[0:25:06] <koutsoupasss> i think their replays should be on point
[0:26:00] <TheFailedStrategist> People not understanding the concept of slow mo FailFish
[0:26:15] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> no it wasn't slow no thought failed
[0:26:38] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> it was just general lag jitter
[0:27:01] <TheFailedStrategist> Let me know if another replay comes up, I’m interested to see what you’re referring to
[0:27:08] <koutsoupasss> @TheFailedStrategist slow motion in games works differently my man
[0:27:50] <koutsoupasss> that was another one
[0:28:03] <koutsoupasss> less laggy but laggy still
[0:28:03] <TheFailedStrategist> You mean like that replay that just happened?
[0:28:13] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> no
[0:28:15] <koutsoupasss> yep
[0:28:34] <koutsoupasss> it was better this time
[0:29:02] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> I think the first reply just dropped frames for a few seconds thus making it seem like lag
[0:29:10] <TheFailedStrategist> It’s esl quality slow motion LUL and what nothing can be done already, this is last year’s tournament
[0:30:53] <koutsoupasss> @TheFailedStrategist it feels bad that they can't set the replays to play properly on a big tournament..there were no lags in other ones i think

[1:14:22] <Fruity2D> hmm, excellent point
[1:14:24] <+Stickypaper> I play better with the M1
[1:14:29] <+gesaodiao> It’s all personal preference

[1:15:19] <+hunterkitchen37> Who in here is an awper?
[1:15:21] <Fruity2D> I like the m1 for the smaller spread

[1:16:22] <GoldHelix316> boston 2018? that was cloud vs faze
[1:16:25] <+hunterkitchen37> Where's device?
[1:16:30] <+gesaodiao> Nip blows man
[1:16:58] <+hunterkitchen37> I hate that FaZe gets to basically the finals of every major, or event and loses.
[1:17:18] <+deathclassiclive> mmm yes yes
[1:17:25] <+hunterkitchen37> Why can't we just win? lol
[1:17:31] <GoldHelix316> well they do play like %85 of the tournys that offer good money
[1:18:45] <+hunterkitchen37> We always do so well in groups and semi's but when the final comes around we play like garbage. like in the last event karrigan dropped over 30 on one of the maps against Fnatic.

[4:59:41] <m00nix> dude check my profile if you want, i only have 6 hours in csgo
[4:59:59] <aqeel_pro> having more FPS is better
[5:00:10] <m00nix> i heard that the more fps, the less latency you have
[5:00:26] <m00nix> but the game is more beautiful in full graphics
[5:00:37] <P0WERADEB0NG> and if you stretch your resolution enemies have bigger heads Kappa
[5:01:19] <m00nix> like 4:3 ?
[5:03:04] <Vladus_s> BCWarrior

[5:03:48] <aqeel_pro> you have a big head and no brains
[5:05:11] <m00nix> why do i stop when i get hit? i can't even run away becasue of that
[5:06:06] <Granur> you dont stop you slow down
[5:06:08] <implicit1> you dont stop, that is called aim punch
[5:06:37] <m00nix> i mean my character becomes so slow that the enemy kills me immediately
