[3:48:15] <+Narwall101> @dvs3k, they are LITERALLY professionals
[3:48:26] <+theitguy> Australia isnt a third world country?
[3:48:29] <cleetx> This tourney's pros around the world, why arent you up there?

[3:50:48] <cleetx> Link your faceit profile then
[3:50:51] <WaitItsJohnCena> even players like nothing arent global, in fact most pros arent global, cause matchmaking is nothing like pro team scene
[3:51:12] <+Narwall101> @dvs3k, level 10 0n faceit=PRO player
[3:51:27] <cleetx> not necessarily
[3:51:46] <ArkeLLbr> So he is obviously dumb @theitguy The division line goes all the way down to keep australia in 1st world countries

[3:56:54] <+Narwall101> global means nothing if youre a pro player
[3:57:03] <fly_cooper_fly> It doesnt mean anything because its too ez
[3:57:07] <+Narwall101> they play rank S
[3:57:12] <Infuriatious> MM doesn't mean anything if you still haven't realized you should quit
[3:57:27] <+Narwall101> to the average player, global is the best you can get
[3:57:38] <Infuriatious> No its not
[3:57:48] <+claustralia22> rank doesnt mean anything
[3:57:48] <+Narwall101> @infuriatious, so if you play mm, you shouldnt play cs?
[3:57:58] <Infuriatious> ^Praise
[3:58:24] <+Narwall101> so silver and a dmg are the same skill level?
[3:58:40] <Infuriatious> Some silvers would destroy some dmgs
[3:58:45] <+Narwall101> what you guys are saying makes no sense
[3:59:03] <+Narwall101> thats absolutey not true, unless they are deranking or smurfs
[3:59:12] <Infuriatious> No it is true
[3:59:18] <HirnloserHans> most people in silver are smurfing and trolling anyways
[3:59:44] <Infuriatious> I'm LEM and 100% of the time there is 1 or 2 person in my team doing 3-20
[3:59:58] <Infuriatious> A silver would have done 12-20 at least
[4:00:50] <fly_cooper_fly> U just have to 30 bomb every game doesnt matter if ur teammates r shit
[4:01:00] <+claustralia22> u can be supreme and crap (maybe good aim, but as a teamplayer crap) or u can be MGE (ok in aim, but really good in teamplay, like timing to support ur mates right)

[7:48:04] <hellter777> really?
[7:48:06] <Meatloaph> C9 looks so bad LUL
[7:48:21] <Div_quintana> m4a1-s you don't see the bullets through smoke, that is the reason you have less bullets aswell
[7:48:29] <hellter777> i read something else but i may be wrong, sorry
[7:48:29] <extase_tv> @Alexeous i would've liked to see Brehze take stewies place, personally i feel that FNS doesn't have the individual skill
[7:48:32] <Div_quintana> it is op for spray
[7:48:38] <+BRENNANiamcool> So do u guys spray? Spray and tap? Or just tap? Because idk why I just tap no matter what
[7:48:44] <gom3zadamz> Faze gunna wreck em
[7:48:57] <+XBarxx> is this lve
[7:49:06] <+zbossman42> prob but c9 fucked faze last time they played
[7:49:10] <RoopBcdeeml> na
[7:49:14] <Div_quintana> no, it says "rerun", it is not live
[7:49:16] <+BRENNANiamcool> FaZe in my mind is a shitty trick shot cod clan
[7:49:17] <gom3zadamz> No its uve
[7:49:17] <Alexeous> Still FNS fits much better in C9 than Stew does in SK
[7:49:23] <extase_tv> @BRENNANiamcool Watch Voo and Natosaphix on Youtube, they are good teachers
[7:49:26] <+Crayola63> when was this game?
[7:49:28] <hellter777> i dont understand why they didnt get n0thing back....and brought this FNS

[7:49:55] <+zbossman42> c9 won
[7:49:55] <waka_flix24> cs is the best in 2k18
[7:50:00] <Alexeous> @Kosss31 It hasn't concluded yet
[7:50:14] <+BRENNANiamcool> Combat arms is far superior than csgo
[7:50:21] <mageofthestorm> that helps.
[7:50:23] <hellter777> yeah....it has been a while....still he has a lot more experience and a lot more skill man
[7:50:24] <+zbossman42> c9 lost cache, won train, then won inferno 22-19 @Kosss31
[7:50:31] <+Crayola63> combat arms is clearly the superior game
[7:50:33] <gom3zadamz> C9 v tyloo LUL
[7:50:33] <Loth1c> what's combat arms and why is CoD still better?

[7:58:43] <+BRENNANiamcool> Because I feel like I'd gelp a lot
[7:58:44] <+Vertex174> which call of duty is this?
[7:58:49] <Cloudspinner> Is it G2 vs fnatic in the next rerun game or ?
[7:58:51] <Meatloaph> since when is Cache a good C9 map? They've always been awful at it
[7:58:53] <gmdk3_yt> owl LUL
[7:58:55] <thigw> @Vertex174 call of duty go

[7:59:39] <thigw> @curryisle they won a major, were great, 2 weeks later they were AWFUL, but when stewie left and fns joined, everyone got good, they're ctually playing very well after fns joined
[7:59:39] <+BRENNANiamcool> Maybe it could be they are across the fuckingg world and not use to the time difference... but I'm wrong
[7:59:42] <+killingblowog> they're so bad they won a major
[7:59:44] <Aqishima> they got to hit that DM server innit LUL

[8:01:38] <Kletza> @killingblowog true
[8:01:41] <mant43> rush clutch with awp c9 vs order was epic

[8:02:18] <+killingblowog> and faze was the best team at the time in the major and they played their maps too
[8:02:20] <thigw> Literally guys, think, they may lose to other top tier teams, of course, there has to be 1 winner and 1 loser, but top tier teams losing for random? only excuse and valid is jetlag

[8:14:32] <aran___> @Dark_Knight72 ever since stewie joined they have lost, i know its just a new change but right now SK isn't doing well

[8:16:14] <MellowMike420> Stewie2 Kappa
[8:16:20] <hellter777> MY opinion about Stew: he had a good run, a good period of time, but he is not one of the top players.....just had a few good games. My proof of this.....he is trash in SK and was pretty much bad for quite a while before leaving....
[8:16:25] <aran___> @jelmervtweel a rumor is that stewie and ska weren't getting along
[8:16:41] <+k3tie> he wants to win he even said it and sk was one of the top teams
[8:17:14] <+Vertex174> I miss shroud
[8:17:27] <skipthegum> stewie is not going to be long in SK

[8:18:49] <Loth1c> what about bullyzoid?
[8:18:52] <+k3tie> tarik has a peanut brain
[8:19:03] <its_nuj> shroud went for the wild plays that's why he never became the best. It was fun to watch though
[8:19:12] <Loth1c> at least it's 1am starting and not 4am, where i'm sleeping BrokeBack
[8:19:12] <Alexeous> @zbossman42 they start at 4 AM for me
[8:19:13] <+Vertex174> oh look autimatic accidentally got 2 frags
[8:19:15] <+k3tie> bullyzoid is ok i guess
[8:19:29] <+k3tie> WHY CANT WE BE FRIENDS
[8:19:41] <hellter777> there are natural born GODS like: Guardian, s1mple, JW... and there are players who became godds because practice
[8:19:59] <Loth1c> jw's era is over ü§î
[8:20:01] <skipthegum> JW :DD
[8:20:01] <+k3tie> jw is fat
[8:20:02] <Alexeous> XANTARES is also a god...
[8:20:11] <ffokcuF_> is he handicAPPPED
[8:20:13] <lexburrat> xeater
[8:20:20] <+k3tie> all silvers are gods
[8:20:22] <jelmervtweel> jw is way to inconcistent
[8:20:23] <+Vertex174> @hellter777 how do you know guardian and simple didnt practice to get good and wasnt born with a zowie in their hands?
[8:20:24] <ffokcuF_> a
[8:20:31] <+Teran1246> plus theres always a difference between someone whos consistent and really good, and someone who can put out godly plays but sometimes just cant hit a shot
[8:21:02] <MellowMike420> "natural talent" is just a way to cope with not being good at something. they all spend thousands of hours practicing
[8:21:13] <+Vertex174> @Teran1246 in a way, every athlete is like that. when its not your day, its not your day
[8:21:20] <MellowMike420> "its not my fault im not pro, i just wasnt born with the natural talent"
[8:21:41] <Alexeous> lol this is awful
[8:21:54] <its_nuj> how do you explain people who have practiced the same amount of time with very different skill levels?
[8:21:54] <thigw> told u? random team. they have a slow reaction
[8:22:00] <lexburrat> nature nurture...
[8:22:07] <thigw> iim sry if ur reading this order guys
[8:22:09] <its_nuj> some people are better at things then others
[8:22:09] <Loth1c> don't think it's pure natural talent.. s1mple for example played since his very early years.. thats dedication
[8:22:18] <stingyptv> Kaies
[8:22:23] <+k3tie> i play rank g so yea but like some pros cant put out plays some pros can put plays every game
[8:22:28] <its_nuj> its 50/50 practice and talent
[8:22:32] <+Teran1246> @Vertex174 true, but i feel some players tend to ahve that more than others. kennyS for example sometimes carrys a game and sometimes just cant do anything for it. i feel like there are players who always get their 1/1 kdr no matter whcih game
[8:22:43] <+nickblv> hard work trumps talent any day.
[8:22:44] <Alexeous> i'd say 75/25
[8:22:49] <thigw> 70 practice 30 talent
[8:22:49] <+Thatzcreepy> @its_nuj Also like time a major factor
[8:23:02] <thigw> @Alexeous nah my n word. 70/30
[8:23:11] <+nickblv> i agree @thigw
[8:23:15] <Alexeous> just say it
[8:23:21] <+Thatzcreepy> most pros end up having 10k hours or so
[8:23:32] <thigw> cant, i will get tii
[8:23:43] <thigw> timed out rofl xd
[8:23:53] <+Teran1246> yeah 10k on csgo alone, not counting 1.6 and css
[8:23:55] <+Just_Chicken> WHAT
[8:24:13] <skipthegum> 10k, half afk
[8:24:17] <ffokcuF_> LINK THE ACCOUNT CANCER
[8:24:27] <thigw> i have 700 hours and i carry global elite players
[8:24:27] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[8:24:27] <+Just_Chicken> the heck kinda commercial timing is this
[8:24:27] <its_nuj> its not just time though. you could have the same amount of hours but have a completely different quality of practice
[8:24:41] <+Teran1246> @skipthegum who doesnt leave their csgo running half of the time altough theyre not playing
[8:24:51] <thigw> I have 700 hours on csgo alone and i carry global elite players
[8:24:51] <its_nuj> like is it consecutive and how focused are you and how good are the people you are practising against
[8:24:54] <skipthegum> i do
[8:25:08] <skipthegum> my cs is always running
[8:25:20] <+Teran1246> dito
[8:25:23] <thigw> i carry global elites and have 700 hours, u guys?
[8:25:24] <+Thatzcreepy> having cs running doesnt mean shit
[8:25:31] <skipthegum> ...
[8:25:33] <+Just_Chicken> I have 600 hours and I struggle to keep GN1
[8:25:41] <+Teran1246> woooooosh
[8:25:45] <+Thatzcreepy> "carry globals" being global doesnt mean anything anymore
[8:25:56] <its_nuj> when i play i don't really try its just for fun so i suck ass but you might look at my hours and think i should be good.
[8:25:56] <Dragon18__> 3am there?
[8:25:59] <thigw> yeah, i have 700 hours and i carry globals
[8:26:01] <+Teran1246> well it does mean that youre on a certain skill lvl.
[8:26:03] <+Vertex174> I carried the entire SK team to the major victory last yeat, I am a silver 1, you?
[8:26:04] <skipthegum> yep being global doesnt mean shit
[8:26:07] <+Thatzcreepy> and if you wanna be a hot shot my friend made global in 60 games
[8:26:12] <thigw> mg1
[8:26:23] <+Teran1246> mg as well
[8:26:42] <thigw> was kiddng bout carrying globals but i carry le
[8:26:45] <420GamingNetwork> mg2 here
[8:26:57] <timmaeh> you can be global but u wont earn money with it :D
[8:27:00] <skipthegum> well when cs was published i was global with 25 games
[8:27:05] <+Teran1246> but im not having problems accepting taht others are simply better then me
[8:27:08] <sunnscope> c9 wins
[8:27:22] <hellter777> why?
[8:27:23] <thigw> i dont accept that others r better, i hacksate a lot
[8:27:28] <its_nuj> pretty sure everyone here is better than me lol
[8:27:30] <timmaeh> i dont care about ranks
[8:27:32] <+Thatzcreepy> cs is do you put time in to the game actively try and get better do you practice in an efficient way so that you can maximize the time you put in. Everyone can put in 10k hours its how do you use those hours
[8:27:32] <hellter777> what did i say?
[8:27:38] <thigw> @its_nuj I am, personally
[8:27:43] <hellter777> it was too long i think
[8:27:54] <hellter777> anyway...doesnt matter anymore
[8:27:57] <rgoldenn> !watchtime
[8:28:01] <+Vertex174> @Teran1246 yes but dont get into it too much. if you start thinking "oh he was just better, I couldnt do anything" you're gonna lose motivation to improve
[8:28:06] <+Thatzcreepy> joining a 3rd party system like Faceit or Esea and then using that as a catalyst to gauge how good you are is a good start

[8:29:19] <hellter777> every GOD has a counter GOD somewhere out there man
[8:29:25] <+Teran1246> true. imo smurfs are one of the biggest issue of csgo mm
[8:29:40] <+Thatzcreepy> they appear in esea and faceit
[8:29:46] <hemanathan> are the cs pro players mostly GE?
[8:29:47] <+Just_Chicken> Well I'm Master Rainbow 17 on CS.
[8:29:55] <ISellFreeMoney> AU CS PogChamp
[8:29:56] <hellter777> there are cs players that dont play pro and can destroy any of the GOD on the scene
[8:30:06] <+Vertex174> I am an elite chiken on csgo
[8:30:09] <+Teran1246> most are between gn1 and gnm
[8:30:09] <+Thatzcreepy> , but any "smurfs" in esea and faceit have been people who deranked by giant loss streaks
[8:30:19] <thigw> Agreed, I hate smurfs and cheaters

[8:31:04] <hellter777> smurfs are part of the game and have always been
[8:31:08] <+Just_Chicken> @KnifeAce you're a bad troll. pointing out live game is a bad giveaway.
[8:31:09] <+Teran1246> cheaters not so much cause you can get them out by banning. but ts always difficult to do sth against smurfers since you cant nail them down on anything

[8:36:17] <+KO0PTV> @Just_Chicken stop... just stop
[8:36:39] <+Vertex174> @Just_Chicken why H1Z1? Radical Heights is better and it's gonna fail before it even releases.
[8:36:46] <Threwed> @hellter777 a lot of people stop playing mm after reaching global or supreme

[8:37:27] <+crankgaming95> @threwed playing mm is the worst. thank God I switched to faceit
[8:37:49] <Threwed> @hellter777 @crankgaming95 if only mm was 128 tick and they did more with only ranks or ladders like face it

[9:13:23] <+Vertex174> my favorite superhero is Flusha, he has the superpower of seeing through walls.
[9:13:32] <$greyscalesMTG> @thenoahtv I mean recent dc, wonder woman has been the only good thing so far

[10:27:21] <iExtremePlayz> true @TheGuyLoveTwitch
[10:27:22] <andl_cs> yea
[10:27:22] <+s0tic> are na players better aim but bad start in general?
[10:27:28] <+69KhaZix69> @tastyeggss still salty eh?
[10:27:32] <+s0tic> bad strat*

[10:27:37] <jeLacaTa> c
[10:27:40] <+enzostamper105> @s0tic not really it's pretty well balanced now
[10:27:43] <+nerdplaow> Na def doesn‚Äôt have better aim
[10:27:49] <+tastyeggss> na has the lowest skill level i think
[10:27:57] <V3tis> best players all all eu
[10:28:05] <Everyminds> its live ?
[10:28:09] <+69KhaZix69> EU lowest IQ unfortunately
[10:28:10] <+s0tic> ok thank you. I pretty much only watch NA cs. Wont even finish a major if NA is knocked out
[10:28:22] <andl_cs> i mean
[10:28:24] <+TheGuyLoveTwitch> @iExtremePlayz Ikr, they should've assigned Fns some other role.
[10:28:25] <+tastyeggss> elige is the only really good na player skill wise imo
[10:28:34] <+s0tic> lol...
[10:28:38] <andl_cs> theres only 2 major NA cs teams lol

[10:28:48] <tavidx> twist is good
[10:28:52] <+enzostamper105> Ya lowest skill that's why NA won the major against an EU superteam LUL

[10:28:59] <+Ananastisch> flipstHYPE
[10:29:03] <+s0tic> yeah I know. So you can see why I asked about the aiming :)
[10:29:03] <Thoralas> Na has a lot of aim but I do think they struggle with producing good igls
[10:29:08] <+tastyeggss> na has one total major and that is a fluke major skadoodle never plays that well
[10:29:10] <andl_cs> theres alot more EU teams than NA teams
[10:29:13] <+nerdplaow> Yeah but they almost got knocked out in the group stage lmao

[10:29:33] <abelisbaas> FaZe LUL
[10:29:34] <tavidx> problem with NA is everyone plays super stupid, the structure isnt there, causes the top teams to struggle to find good practice
[10:29:40] <+TheGuyLoveTwitch> I think Australis is the strongest team atm
[10:29:42] <T9kenR6> Fns is calling now
[10:29:42] <+Teran1246> lol that explains everything
[10:29:46] <tavidx> nitro whined about that once about having a hard time getting scrims against a team with any structure
[10:29:49] <+enzostamper105> @pm_me_yaoi_pics they were before olof left and they were clear favorites for the major at the beginning of the year after sk lost

[10:29:53] <+s0tic> WHY does na suck so bad and inconsistent compared to EU?
[10:29:58] <Thoralas> And it leads to inconsistency when they aren't hitting their shots

[12:49:43] <JayTeexo> theres a rank for a reason if everyone stuck to there own rank and didnt try to rank the friends up or try enjoying the game from a lower rank then there would be no problem
[12:49:49] <+yNzx_> @jayteexo all the good players don‚Äôt play mm so the ranks really doesn‚Äôt matter that much. Even if you‚Äôre global you can suck in the game

[13:41:26] <+sohieb> roma vs liverpool ? :v
[13:41:44] <moonwiring> FOOTBALL
[13:41:56] <moonwiring> NOT SOCCER
[13:41:58] <W9ll3> not soccer
[13:42:10] <Amer_s7> Liverpool for sure
[13:42:14] <Barraccus> Liverpool, but roma had a penalty that was not seen by the referee. Anyways liverpool deserved win, and hope they win Madrid cheaters
[13:43:15] <Amer_s7> madrid are truly cheates
[13:43:31] <moonwiring> red bull gives you wings
[13:43:32] <dinac17> madrid players have nothing to do with it tho

[13:44:44] <Rahsberryripple> barca are worse cheats tbh
[13:44:54] <wewhpt123> I think real madrid would win 4-1 score
[13:44:54] <Rahsberryripple> uefalona
[13:45:19] <Barraccus> Liverpool defense is pretty weak yeah..
[13:45:29] <Barraccus> hope they improve for the final
[13:45:38] <sonikISBACKBABY222> i thought i just donated 8000000 bits
[13:45:45] <Amer_s7> ya im with you in that point

[13:45:52] <wewhpt123> Nah they will play with pressure being in the finals they will score less :/
[13:46:00] <treemann_is_real> arnold was very weak today
[13:46:11] <wewhpt123> But madrid has experience
[13:46:24] <wewhpt123> Obvious win for madrid but wishing for a thrilling game
[13:46:34] <dinac17> madrid will play insane in the finals and win unfortunately
