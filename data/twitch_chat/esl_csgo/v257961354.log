[6:57:09] <kingm0nsta> np bb
[6:57:10] <LEoNlAsKy> KennyS is not that good nowadays because no one can cover his back when kenny awping
[6:57:21] <cursedcsgotv> @brennan149888 faze and astralis
[6:57:22] <c0rted> astralis vs faze

[6:57:29] <kingm0nsta> Preds?
[6:57:40] <LEoNlAsKy> VP vs Nip in the grand final
[6:57:42] <kingm0nsta> I say FaZe 3-2 it will be a good series
[6:57:47] <brennan149888> @LEoNlAsKy tru that's the main reason they lose no one is coverin Kenny when he is covering everyone
[6:57:49] <+K3l3ndis> Niko will destroy Astralis
[6:57:53] <LEoNlAsKy> FaZe always chocks
[6:58:03] <kingm0nsta> guardian just wants to win man
[6:58:15] <RoopBcdeeml> faze us overrated because s1mple just carries while shox just complains and leaves coldzera out to dry
[6:58:23] <Renetron24> and he desserves it
[6:58:36] <c0rted> Faze cant play alot of maps
[6:58:50] <kingm0nsta> they do get puggy a lot
[6:58:56] <RoopBcdeeml> exactly and stewie2k just holds them back
[6:58:57] <ZeckFerreira> vac
[6:59:02] <LEoNlAsKy> coldzera always bait TACO to get kills though thats what he do
[6:59:08] <c0rted> they can play a few but even those maps astralis may even play better
[6:59:12] <froex1337> Vac
[6:59:24] <LEoNlAsKy> without TACO being a bait Sk going down
[6:59:31] <SimpZe> FAZE WILL CHOKE TOMORROW LUL
[6:59:44] <RoopBcdeeml> yeah he does he also baited skadoodle into a crossfire vs rpk and steel
[7:00:10] <c0rted> kenny has shox doe

[10:55:04] <+AnxietySociiety> @arthurrbe boltz? he's probably been their worst, all things considered
[10:55:16] <+AnxietySociiety> they will replace him
[10:55:24] <+makemagik> Much respect from Karigan
[10:55:31] <gabrieltfm11> @ZeckFerreira qual patente vc √©?
[10:55:44] <+Teran1246> i think stewie was a mistake. nothing against stewie, but sk had played with 5 brasilians for such a long time. its so difficult doign it all on english now. why not get a young brasilian talent? wouldve been the better way to solve the problem
[10:55:44] <arthurrbe> @AnxietySociiety i think they wont replace. Now coldzera is the IGL, so i think things will change for SK.
[10:56:09] <+pure420kush> Brazilian Players are awesome, pretty cool they are up there in the top
[10:56:11] <arthurrbe> @Teran1246 sure, that s exactly what happened

[10:56:13] <altay1906> Depends he just needs to adapt
[10:56:14] <Werewolfmecha> Wy did olof quit faze?
[10:56:16] <+AnxietySociiety> @arthurrbe yeah, it might throttle Cold's fragging abilities, so i would hope Stewie and fer step up

[10:56:58] <+Teran1246> sk will need quite some time to get back on the level of the best teams out there. same with c9
[10:56:59] <arthurrbe> @AnxietySociiety i think they will replace fer. I can see in his eyes that he is not liking to play anymore
[10:57:08] <JeraldLIVE> wow, compensating for something there?
[10:57:16] <altay1906> yes you're right
[10:57:30] <+pure420kush> Olof had ‚Äùpersonal problems‚Äù. Does Anyone know the specific reason why Olof left???

[10:57:43] <JeraldLIVE> short and thick or long and thin
[10:58:02] <+Teran1246> well i dont think everyone agreed on stew from sk. it might be more difficult for one of the members than for others.
[10:58:13] <Lefo0u> the crowd is to loud, this is why they have this big thingny

[10:58:27] <arthurrbe> @AnxietySociiety yep, i agree, but i would like to replace him for Felps, do you now felps?
[10:58:38] <arthurrbe> know*
[10:58:40] <altay1906> yes but Sk need time
[10:58:47] <+AnxietySociiety> @arthurrbe yeah, felps is the best one outside of SK prob
[10:59:14] <+vigilantbean> does anyone here know when the finals start est?
[10:59:17] <arthurrbe> @AnxietySociiety felps is so agressive, plays like fer
[10:59:26] <+Compl9x> 1AM EST
[10:59:34] <altay1906> No because stewie doesnt fit in Felps role
[10:59:40] <+Teran1246> its in 5 and a half hours. can calculate the rest :)
[10:59:40] <+vigilantbean> ok thank you SeemsGood
[10:59:45] <+Compl9x> Stewie sucks on SK
[10:59:55] <+Compl9x> and i am happy he left C9. He made Shroud and nothing gone :(
[11:00:00] <swgzsd5> tyloo cost 60000usd/month
[11:00:21] <arthurrbe> @Compl9x unfortunately
[11:00:21] <+AnxietySociiety> @Compl9x shroud wasn't that good though
[11:00:25] <+Teran1246> @Compl9x and he made skadoodle leave. ska is back partially because stewie left
[11:00:42] <AgusNC1> who's this douche?
[11:00:44] <ZeckFerreira> kkkk esse cara a√≠
[11:00:53] <+pure420kush> Shroud was famous for Done crazy sprays at times. But hes just a streamer imo
[11:01:00] <arthurrbe> whats happening LOLOLOL
[11:01:35] <+Compl9x> i love this guy
[11:01:37] <+AnxietySociiety> shroud had that one really good tournament (cologne) and everybody rated him as some legend, he's a good player but he was never a big LAN performer
[11:01:50] <domcsgo> guys does someone know when exactly the game starts. in how many hours
[11:01:52] <+Teran1246> shroud stopped putting in the effort because he lost interest. thats why he dropped off in the end. altough he was not the best fragger, i think his spraycontrol and spray transfer was one of the best ever
[11:02:00] <AgusNC1> why give screen time to this moron?

[11:32:12] <DarkElektro> 60 fps is good. Anything over that is maybe smoother, but still, its overkill. Expensive graphics cards arn't cool. Also RAM market is rigged in my opinion. Cheaper stuff rulez!

[11:35:29] <DarkElektro> @pure420kush I hear ya, but for me, 60 fps is great
[11:36:00] <DarkElektro> I think alot of companies want to make as much money as possible, so they invent stuff like this
[11:36:14] <Gleern> !final
[11:36:18] <gluttononoussloth> @Gleern team would never workout
[11:36:18] <DarkElektro> But constant 60fps for me is great in any game
[11:36:45] <Gleern> @gluttononoussloth why not?
[11:37:07] <sober_canadian> 16-3
[11:37:08] <gluttononoussloth> but would be cool@Gleern
[11:37:11] <+TheeDarkest> 165hz sweet spot for me, 60fps feels so slow to me now

[12:40:09] <+LuciusDevereaux> noise cancellation isn't perfect, current state of the art active noise cancellation still can't completely block out all surrounding sound

[12:41:21] <BigDaddyRoad69> the booths look bad so some places dont use them
[12:41:21] <+LuciusDevereaux> no it doesn't completely block out sound, there's a reason sony and other audio companies are still innovating and experimenting
[12:41:41] <onepagedownz> monkey
[12:41:45] <+Nasmo> Even if you can hear the crowd, if you react slower you lose, doesn't change enough to be a concern, pros cheating tho
[12:41:58] <HarghY> nobody is saying it does @LuciusDevereaux we're saying they dont have booths. and wondering why not
[12:42:23] <BigDaddyRoad69> booths look like shit on stage
[12:42:28] <+Dominagoogintage> Pro cheating suspicions aren‚Äôt the same as a problem we know can be fixed
[12:42:36] <+Nasmo> It looks more professional with booths
[12:42:39] <+LuciusDevereaux> @harghy I'm just trying to let people know pros can still hear "sound"
[12:42:46] <LazerDoofus> booths are hard to get up to fire code in many countries
[12:42:53] <Polonium2> LOL look at the despo tweets
[12:42:53] <+Dominagoogintage> I think the biggest issue is that the players lose that special connection with the crowd
[12:42:54] <HarghY> booths look great if you do them right, check out DAC and the international
