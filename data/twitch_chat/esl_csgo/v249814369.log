[2:01:53] <C_A_R_D_S> australian football
[2:02:04] <XAllen86> Zimbabwe‚Äôs football
[2:02:04] <zanics> is bad
[2:02:13] <C_A_R_D_S> is better than both
[2:02:19] <texteriouz> Janko Kreygasm
[2:02:20] <zanics> afl is very bad, rugby is good
[2:02:31] <zanics> afl is just netball crossed with rubgy union
[2:02:33] <ScottBoomser> Good afternoon fellow viewers
[2:02:37] <oneballmann> doesnt matter which football, its in every sport the same FailFish
[2:02:37] <texteriouz> hand egg wrestling SeemsGood
[2:02:40] <BotKnockOut_EC> League is great then every sport
[2:02:40] <Halted> meh, sports
[2:02:50] <C_A_R_D_S> in proportion to populations that play each version of football afl is the most popular football league in the world. nrl is better than rugby
[2:03:06] <MGPT> What you need to be a proffesional football trainer to know a player is playing bad? LUL
[2:03:07] <zanics> sorry yeh thats what i mean when i say rugbyu, i should say nrl
[2:03:16] <BotKnockOut_EC> NRL>Union>Soccer
[2:03:24] <zanics> afl is entirely in like victoria and nsw
[2:03:35] <zanics> its barely even a thing up here in qlld
[2:03:41] <texteriouz> Premier League Kreygasm
[2:03:46] <C_A_R_D_S> nah afl is vic, sa, was, nt, and tas. nrl is nsw and qld
[2:03:49] <0Golden0> cause queens are shit
[2:03:53] <Halted> yeah well my sportsball team will kick your sportsballs teams but then take them out for ice cream Kappa
[2:03:56] <BotKnockOut_EC> Wat, In NSW league is the main sport played
[2:04:01] <zanics> queenslanders are shit i cant disagree
[2:04:02] <C_A_R_D_S> afl is only popular in small country towns down south nsm
[2:04:12] <zanics> but stiull nrl is better
[2:04:15] <XAllen86> Football is original in England none of this afl shit more like Premier League
[2:04:17] <0Golden0> @zanics LUl
[2:04:17] <C_A_R_D_S> queensland is a nice place with shit people
[2:04:40] <C_A_R_D_S> @XAllen86 afl was officially codified before soccer and rugby
[2:04:43] <oneballmann> i cant watch the american football, i am just assuming its pretty similiar to australian football, because the ultra long pauses destroys the hole vibe..
[2:04:55] <texteriouz> Australian Football League LUL
[2:04:57] <BotKnockOut_EC> I live down in Illawarra NSW, Bunch if bogans but beautiful place and most people are nice
[2:05:00] <XAllen86> What source did you use? Australian Wiki?
[2:05:05] <C_A_R_D_S> @oneballmann australian football is nothing like american football
[2:05:08] <zanics> yeh like the sport itself is pretty neat but its just basically been ruined by corporate america to the point its unwatchable
[2:05:16] <C_A_R_D_S> there are no stoppages in aussie football
[2:05:17] <0Golden0> When you say football you mean soccer or rugby Kappa
[2:05:20] <zanics> wayyyy too many ads and shit
[2:05:25] <oneballmann> soccer is good, but i dont watch it anymore because of the hole scandals with fifa, now the world championship is in quatar??? are you serious? FailFish
[2:05:36] <zanics> just watch EPL its the only decent league

[2:06:48] <OmegaPlayzs> hi my global friends

[2:07:12] <+Rowey> Esport or no sport
[2:07:12] <texteriouz> @BotKnockOut_EC Seems like you don't understand the game Kappa
[2:07:25] <ManicMunday> @C_A_R_D_S ay my man, been watching much of this matchup?

[2:09:03] <zanics> demanding in its own way
[2:09:08] <BotKnockOut_EC> Yep so true @zanics
[2:09:26] <zanics> they get less substitutes iirc so most players are on the field all game
[2:09:31] <ManicMunday> @C_A_R_D_S after this series... It is gunna be a blood bath, one sided halfs I reckon

[2:13:58] <ManicMunday> @Newyyyy somewhat
[2:14:11] <SentientProgram> what team is the favorite going in?
[2:14:14] <+Newyyyy> love their logo ^^
[2:14:15] <ManicMunday> With all the roster changes Chiefs have gone through it is a little tricky to say
[2:14:42] <C_A_R_D_S> yeah theres been a roster shuffle in oce the last few days for those who dont know
[2:14:46] <+Newyyyy> if only they would play fast again and not like that -.-
[2:14:49] <oneballmann> i like tainted minds, but order seems like very strong atm
[2:14:50] <Sheep> TTours
[2:14:57] <giner12_> only win the eco rounds
[2:15:33] <ManicMunday> @oneballmann it is a very interesting time for AU with their 'top tier' teams
[2:16:35] <BotKnockOut_EC> Well we have renegades (technically)
[2:16:43] <realherbacide> this is the only game today or is there more?

[2:17:16] <ManicMunday> @BotKnockOut_EC AU Detroit Renegades LUL
[2:17:19] <kingwickeddd> Only to a certain extent tho, cause AU's "top tier" has always only been like 4 at max because there always seems to be a big gap between top 2 and the rest or top 4 and the rest
[2:17:34] <markzke> SnickersHype
[2:17:44] <ManicMunday> @kingwickeddd definitely agree mate
[2:17:47] <BotKnockOut_EC> @manicmunday LUL MingLee
[2:18:03] <kingwickeddd> Like taboo make it to CGPL and all cause the ath roster died, which is technically top 4, but they're so far behind they get 16-0'd by order and 16-3'd by TM etc
[2:18:23] <+Z1NQ> ;
[2:18:23] <Teralm> @kingwickeddd ouch
[2:18:41] <kingwickeddd> I'm not talking shit, they genuinely just got 16-0'd by Order tonight
[2:18:58] <ManicMunday> @kingwickeddd by my statement I kind of meant like the teams as a whole, not the scene haha
