[1:13:38] <+curryisle> Super Kilt
[1:13:50] <techsn0w> @drainbabe Theres not really a #1 team, but its probably SK, FaZe, or C9 at the moment. Thats only because they place well in Major tournaments though
[1:13:59] <+curryisle> or Super Kek
[1:14:03] <signup111> c9 LUL

[1:15:32] <tarik_s> 31
[1:15:32] <chrischan1996> not so much as a fragger
[1:15:33] <innerfire77> c9's major was just a fluke, they are barely surviving against teams like grayhound
[1:16:21] <techsn0w> @innerfire77 Well usually lower tier teams can dominate because they have that unexpected strategy and stuff like that. They can do their homework on C9's strats easily
[1:16:22] <AncheR_11> Is this live?
[1:16:33] <Uchihamadara096> nop
[1:16:38] <signup111> yes
[1:16:38] <techsn0w> @chrischan1996 FNS needs to be both, or else they can't do anything

[1:17:02] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[1:17:09] <techsn0w> Then again, C9's been quite Jet lagged since this tourney is in Aus.
[1:17:16] <innerfire77> @techsn0w true, they are less spectated, but the bigger teams have better individuals and also tactics for almost every situations
[1:17:25] <+curryisle> major wasn;t a fluke, they wanted it all of them
[1:17:36] <RainbowWorrior> @techsn0w jet lag hahahahahahah brah please
[1:17:53] <+curryisle> but after winning something like that and acquiring all that paper for c9, you get complacent af
[1:18:07] <techsn0w> @innerfire77 Yeah, I'm not trying to make any excuses for them. @rainbowworrior Yes, skadoodle was saying he was "jet lagged" after posting multiple times on social media
[1:18:17] <+curryisle> i'd be a lazy ass after a major win lol
[1:18:23] <signup111> jetlad
[1:18:43] <techsn0w> I guess underdogs make it interesting though
[1:19:07] <In0112358> is this live ?
[1:19:08] <+curryisle> I actually enjoy the underdogs upsetting these teams
[1:19:11] <techsn0w> Since they can have their own fan bases and its fun to watch fresh new teams and players than the nornal top 10 or 4 in the finals
[1:19:27] <techsn0w> me too @curryisle
[1:19:30] <innerfire77> the major was a fluke, almost every EU team (except gambit) and SK which won a major had a decent time after it and dominated for a while. C9 just died after it.
[1:19:46] <Dellcal> @curryisle yea this is real CS
[1:20:17] <+curryisle> i think you should let it go @innerfire77 it's history now and tough shet
[1:20:20] <techsn0w> @innerfire77 then again, SK did pretty bad as well this tournament
[1:20:30] <chrischan1996> I don't bet because I'm not a degenerate anymore, but one of my betting strats used to be betting against major winning teams right after they win it
[1:20:31] <Rwoarrr> yea cause tim and stewie got sk offers and ska quit
[1:20:36] <elravo> Yeah they bommmbed
[1:20:40] <Aegon_tv> imagine being salty NA won a major LUL
[1:20:52] <+curryisle> Everyone knew or should have known c9 would be lazyarse bots after major win
[1:21:06] <techsn0w> @innerfire77 Astralis was probably most consistent i must admit
[1:21:11] <uOBJ> did Faze win earlier?
[1:21:28] <innerfire77> @curryisle yeah, but I hate the arrogance of NA's fans not admitting the simple truth that their CS just got better and it's not THE best. @techsn0w SK is lost since the Krakow major.
[1:21:29] <chrischan1996> yes, faze won
[1:21:34] <+Rabeyee> 007

[1:22:27] <techsn0w> @innerfire77 teams always change in and out though, its never really a "stable" #1 champion for too long. The longest would probably be SK, but after Krakow they got really shut down.
[1:22:44] <elravo> How did the aussies do today?
[1:22:52] <Aegon_tv> ?????????????????
[1:22:56] <chrischan1996> there is a site called HLTV where you can check scores and news related to cs
[1:22:56] <ZoumBaDouWowPifPif> because everyone copied them.
[1:23:23] <elravo> Right O hero
[1:23:26] <techsn0w> @chrischan1996 HLTV is a meme and their team charts and scores are only based off of valve majors ;-;
[1:23:26] <ponkkiz> so is olof going back to faze or did he quit for good?
[1:23:29] <innerfire77> @techsn0w Nip? Fnatic? They are alongside SK in terms of dominance, problem is that ppl adapt and some things don't work anymore. THat's the beauty of this game.
[1:23:31] <augustinelis9> who is won finals?
[1:23:34] <ZoumBaDouWowPifPif> everyone copied SK's play style so now they are not as powerfull as they were
[1:23:40] <chrischan1996> @techsn0w you know, there is a team called NiP
[1:23:59] <+pdpceo23> no girls were seen

[1:38:04] <innerfire77> it's normal for these players to be burnt out of the game - 6 years playing the same game, so many situations and stuff.

[1:40:36] <chrischan1996> @playmesh I'm still waiting for you to point out wrong things I said
[1:40:38] <playmesh> kennys is the best player on g2 esports and one of the top awper in the world right now
[1:40:54] <chrischan1996> @playmesh true, kenny is a great awper
[1:41:01] <+curryisle> kennyS is washed up
[1:41:02] <playmesh> simple, guardian being better than him atm
[1:41:03] <itzBLEZZ> @playmesh please, don't make me laugh again. stomach hurts.
[1:41:09] <+SirBewick> I love KennyS but this is just not true anymore
[1:41:16] <chrischan1996> yes, they are, I agree
[1:41:24] <Glockateer> @curryisle ya, $500 and gets a kill half the time
[1:41:59] <BenisKhan> is NepBK still a thing? Kappa
[1:42:05] <jynxeddd> s1mple guardian clear the top two awpers in the world atm
[1:42:09] <innerfire77> I am not sure what's better in terms of being fair - the CZ era or tec 9 era. One is for sure - ppl hate it like fck
[1:42:37] <+curryisle> guardian yes s1mple gets a lot of fall in the lap kills while he's trying to watch 80 angles
[1:42:43] <Glockateer> tec9 was worse, it had better accuracy and a million ammo
[1:42:55] <jynxeddd> ethan is such an ego farmer lmao
[1:42:58] <+SirBewick> @innerfire77 Tec9 seems fair to me
[1:42:59] <chrischan1996> @playmesh still waiting for it

[1:43:19] <+curryisle> @Glockateer freescroll fire tec9
[1:43:25] <Glockateer> the tec9 had 32 bullets, and the running shot accuracy like a glock
[1:43:35] <jynxeddd> if they just nerfed the czs bodyshot damage it would be balanced
[1:43:36] <playmesh> what you mean
[1:43:38] <Glockateer> thats more than the cz has total
[1:43:39] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[1:43:51] <+AlrexAspiration> cz has been in that state for years and no one cared about it. they didnt buff it or anything
[1:43:54] <+curryisle> no cz damage needs nerfed
[1:43:56] <chrischan1996> @playmesh you said I have no idea what I'm talking about, why?
[1:44:06] <+curryisle> the run and gun accuracy and RNG needs eliminated
[1:44:08] <playmesh> you said he wasnt even top orbers
[1:44:09] <+SirBewick> @innerfire77 I play CSGO since 2013, I still think CZ era is worse
[1:44:16] <jynxeddd> the cz atm is definitely op
[1:44:24] <mozos1> tec9 era was dope man
[1:44:24] <@Moobot> IEM Sydney day 4 starts in about: 16h 47m 5s

[1:44:52] <playmesh> kk
[1:44:54] <jynxeddd> it needs to be nerfed but not as badly as the tec 9, the tec9 is unusable now
[1:45:20] <chrischan1996> tec9 and 5-7 are fine now
[1:45:20] <Glockateer> the five-seven is really good, but yes, the cz outshines the tec9 now
[1:45:27] <+curryisle> these games used to be mostly pure skill based now it's RNG because of their laziness on keeping VACation up to date. Still rocking 1.6 and css databases lol
[1:45:31] <jynxeddd> the tec9 is trash
[1:45:33] <mozos1> @jynxeddd nah dont nerf it like dis is good
[1:45:42] <norskeNNNN> WutFace
[1:45:44] <+AlrexAspiration> the cz is not op. it has clear weaknesses: ammo. and bad on longrange. And the fact that you can buy it as ct and t makes it way more balanced then the tec9 earlier days

[1:46:50] <mozos1> @AlrexAspiration dude 1 hs with the cz = 95-97 damage if you have good accuracy than the ammo shouldnt be a problem but the main issue is the reload time of the cz thats where i die most of

[4:00:12] <Cidraque> can you explain me what is the meaning of these olofmeister joke?
[4:00:36] <SootyCorn1> Fnatic used a illegal boost and olof use scout and auto sniper to kill everyone from across the map
[4:00:54] <summit1gwastaken> True
[4:01:01] <Cidraque> @SootyCorn1 lol
[4:01:06] <shreyshai> Hows that illegal just bc fnatic used it it became illegal
[4:01:12] <SootyCorn1> thus "olofpass"
[4:01:12] <@Moobot> IEM Sydney day 4 starts in about: 14h 30m 17s
[4:01:18] <Therappe02> wasn't illegal tbh , just smart use of the pixel walk
[4:01:43] <SootyCorn1> He couldnt be seen from the places he was shooting at on that boost, its pretty much like WH
[4:01:45] <Therappe02> There was no rule that said you couldn't pixel walk so
[4:01:54] <GLihhh> G2 lose to mouse rip.... Mau5
[4:02:12] <SootyCorn1> and they never got punished for it, but they exploted a loophole nonetheless
[4:02:14] <Therappe02> Yes he could lol

[6:16:08] <Kotch_> RalpherZ
[6:16:10] <Avakjhawk> But has Tyloo improved or is Renegades just trash
[6:16:10] <fygogogo> Tyloo won
[6:16:12] <iannnnn> tylul won
[6:16:14] <+Sukingo> lmao I love when the ads show up
[6:16:14] <Alllu2000> i no want vcomerical

[6:16:24] <Avakjhawk> 🤔
[6:16:31] <first_black_man_in_space> navi wonned\
[6:16:32] <EOORotn> @fygogogo the question is if they can beat astralis tho :D
[6:16:32] <fygogogo> Tyloo also beat SK and C9
[6:16:44] <tiokeiko> Sydney <3
[6:16:49] <melon_fps> tyloo won 2:0, but imo its just bntet permafrost so well and carried them to the semi finals

[6:17:31] <alvislam1996> Commercial break in rerun wtf
[6:17:37] <fygogogo> I think Tyloo is also running pretty solid as a team compared to before, the decision making and everything
[6:17:42] <+Sukingo> 8k this mornin'
[6:17:43] <SempaxRobekZ> bntet and xcurate make tyloo stronger
[6:17:54] <Skeetley> they always do commercial breaks so they cna make money
[6:17:54] <fygogogo> Ye definitely
[6:17:59] <iamihop> jesus, if they dont want me to mute the ads, they need to not make them twice as loud as the content.
[6:18:06] <moreiragui> hdaue uas q ba w q

[6:21:54] <vox37> guadian is sick awper
[6:22:01] <Skeetley> kennys, fallen, simple, and guardian are all pretty close together so idk who is the best
[6:22:13] <EOORotn> fallen may be in top 5, but not the best imo
[6:22:15] <vox37> crazy how astralis are doing sick now. Looking so unbeatable
[6:22:16] <Skeetley> JW is pretty good too
[6:22:17] <fygogogo> Consistency is the key
[6:22:22] <+Sukingo> Kenny is still pretty good, but not insane like he used to be. Thanks to the nerf
[6:22:25] <EOORotn> ye
[6:22:27] <+infamous_andrew> oh device
[6:22:31] <fygogogo> I want to see Tyloo vs Astralis
[6:22:49] <Tasticsowns> i feel like guardian is the most consistent
[6:22:51] <T9kenR6> Device is a good awper he isn’t flashy tho
[6:22:56] <melon_fps> tyloo probably get 32:0 d lol
[6:22:57] <+BobVegana> i am the best awp
[6:23:00] <EOORotn> @fygogogo ast vs tyloo or faze i think
[6:23:04] <playmesh> What did the score become?
[6:23:15] <fygogogo> @eoorotn yes m8
[6:23:33] <fygogogo> 9:6
[6:23:40] <Skeetley> ah yes @BobVegana is the real best AWPer, he makes kennys, fallen, simple, and guardian look like silvers
[6:23:46] <vox37> fnatic and astra final
[6:24:03] <+BobVegana> f0rest is the best awp
[6:24:07] <rigack_> why no faze?
[6:24:28] <KaboomTV> HeyGuys
[6:24:29] <vox37> think faze will fall short against fnatic

[8:46:43] <mrak47z> SHROUUUUD THEY NEEED YU
[8:46:48] <fredwicke> i dont get why c9 would change their igl from tarik after winning last major to FNS, makes no sense
[8:46:48] <$se4n> Gg
[8:46:52] <i_mdkaif> shroud god
[8:47:06] <melon_fps> i know FNS is bad but cmon, shroud is just another mediocre player too

[8:47:49] <batman1598753> @vampervamp nope its rerun
[8:47:57] <+midas1> can the casters be any more biased? it's getting ridiculous LUL
[8:47:57] <fredwicke> making any changes after winning a major a week or so before the next major makes no sense
[8:48:12] <+iWantTheW> ^
[8:48:15] <fredwicke> dont fix what aint broke
[8:48:17] <+crabclaw18> C9 thought process: Win major = lose best player, pick up garbage and make him igl
[8:48:29] <melon_fps> lol these shroud fans are implying shroud is in the same level of kennys and 2k
[8:48:31] <GODMIKEPMP> Stewie wanted to leave guys
[8:48:34] <+iWantTheW> what is igl?
[8:48:40] <panch0998> gg so ez noobs
[8:48:45] <mrak47z> in game leader
[8:48:48] <i_mdkaif> Shroud is god
[8:48:51] <GODMIKEPMP> c9 didn't want to let go of Stewie
[8:48:57] <+remmiic> @fredwicke yeah but stewie left so they needed the fire power
[8:48:57] <Tniiick101> stewie is not best player, nor was it their choice to kick him because he left.
[8:48:57] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[8:49:01] <i_mdkaif> the wayhe plays is just awesome
[8:49:01] <VetKin214> I think Stewie applied for the SK opening, not really kicked
[8:49:04] <GODMIKEPMP> Autimatic had an option to go to SK but didnt want it cause hes a winner.
[8:49:10] <+iWantTheW> @Tniiick101 thank you
[8:49:27] <i_mdkaif> stewie not performing well in sk
[8:49:27] <fredwicke> stewie wasn't the best, no where near automatic my pick
[8:49:46] <i_mdkaif> there's no co-ordination between them
[8:49:49] <GODMIKEPMP> Beatles shouldn't have broken up either, if it ain't broke don't fix it.
[8:49:59] <+iWantTheW> 2k is really good but he left C9 did not drop him
[8:49:59] <melon_fps> seriously? he got so bad performance in every lan tournament and imo shroud leaving the roster is the best move for c9
[8:50:00] <fredwicke> astralis my pick for winner of this major

[8:54:09] <HTXhots> ^^
[8:54:21] <fredwicke> imo, international tournament with almost every top team, i'd call it a major still, even if esl doesn't consider it
[8:54:25] <+xarx> is the next major in london'>?
[8:54:34] <HTXhots> You can call it whatever you want, It doesn't make it so :P

[9:26:17] <cinho1995> Rush by awp
[9:26:18] <PovertyFair> @beatsnesboy this is a rerun
[9:26:31] <+crabclaw18> they need to buff the cz
[9:26:36] <beatsnesboy> @povertyfair thanks
[9:26:46] <fredwicke> cz is already pretty legit
[9:26:47] <tomwyr_> @crabclaw18 you mean its price LUL
[9:26:55] <PovertyFair> @crabclaw18 hell yeah, make it $300 :3
[9:27:10] <PovertyFair> @crabclaw18 3 24round mags too
[9:27:19] <zSeergio_> +1
[9:27:25] <fredwicke> uh, that would make it op so badly
[9:27:43] <PovertyFair> Yeeeee, then maybe I could get outta Gold Nova
[9:27:51] <fredwicke> an automatic with 24 rounds, close to ump only 300 dollars? jokes son
[9:28:00] <perpo05> apex 0-8 LUL Kappa
[9:28:02] <+QWERTYIN> cz best gun in the game
[9:28:17] <Whofednami> make the bullets hit like an ak too
[9:28:25] <+QWERTYIN> true
[9:28:25] <PovertyFair> Tbh dont touch the CZ, I'd be really mad if they nerfed it
[9:28:28] <Hikiet> this match is in live?
[9:28:41] <Whofednami> it's not balanced honestly
[9:28:44] <assass1nat0rdt> nope rerun

[9:28:48] <fredwicke> dont touch the cz, make the tec9 great again, they nerfed that so badly
[9:28:48] <PovertyFair> Too many people complain about it imo, MAYBE nerf the jump accuracy
[9:28:50] <+BZizzlez> dust 2 POGGERS
[9:28:51] <+QWERTYIN> at least make the cz $600 or somit tbh
[9:29:15] <+QWERTYIN> gun is an easy 2 kill
[9:29:21] <FRAN_CHRIS> apex tilt!
[9:29:36] <PovertyFair> kenny cmon, land the fuckin shot
[9:29:55] <FjaalarBerqvist> put deagle and cz in same slot rather than shitt 57 and tec9

[9:30:28] <perpo05> 0-10 on lan LUL
[9:30:38] <PovertyFair> I'd rather not decide between Deagle or CZ... CZ would be too weak at 700$ and Deag would be OP at 500

[9:31:56] <+Huliboo> OH MY GAWD A DOG
[9:32:10] <fredwicke> eh, if you know how to use the deag, i can one shot with a deag at really far distance, can't with cz
[9:32:14] <+missl2ob0t> I like the deagle better too... but cz is deadlier these days
[9:32:14] <sabensilverxd> no,my seltection is cz :D
[9:32:20] <AidaOne> oh my
[9:32:31] <fredwicke> cz closer range, deag for long and one shot capability
[9:32:41] <+BobVegana> p250
[9:32:42] <fredwicke> depends on situation
[9:33:04] <mcdonaltsgt> p250 is my favourite
[9:33:07] <fredwicke> p250 for me, 300 make money back with one kill, one shot capability without headamor, ill take it anyday on a save
[9:33:08] <tomwyr_> Cologne PogChamp on Facebook ResidentSleeper
[9:33:20] <+BobVegana> grinded from silver to silver 5 with p250

[9:33:44] <sabensilverxd> i love the p250, its best of eco
[9:33:44] <+missl2ob0t> true, but if you got a cz you can place yourself in a position where it's the best weapon in the game, then take the rifle off that person you just executed without a chance
[9:33:59] <mcdonaltsgt> i like five seven too
[9:33:59] <vekassyilles> Shrek dies in Infinit War
[9:34:02] <sabensilverxd> yes
[9:34:03] <+BobVegana> cz is for spray noobs

[9:39:42] <Dagyhymode> cs is still cs
[9:39:43] <GODMIKEPMP> @tomwyr_ kids have been making that statement since 2000.
[9:39:48] <marcoslzn> cs fr BibleThump
[9:39:53] <+BZizzlez> EZ for MS
[9:40:06] <GODMIKEPMP> 18 years 250k/500k later...
[9:40:12] <fredwicke> beta 6, somehow i dont believe you
[9:40:28] <sabensilverxd> i think cs is dying
[9:40:35] <Lord__Jonathan> Rip g2
[9:40:41] <+QWERTYIN> deaded game
[9:40:51] <GODMIKEPMP> The reason CS GO(competitive) will never die cause what is its competition? nothing
[9:40:58] <sabensilverxd> everybody playing pubg
[9:41:02] <crisis_christ> gg for pubg boyzz))
[9:41:04] <GODMIKEPMP> people need their competitive FPS
[9:41:12] <sabensilverxd> yes
[9:41:14] <Whofednami> maybe but the pro scene is always fun to watch
[9:41:14] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[9:41:18] <tomwyr_> @GODMIKEPMP I mean, if Valve wont do anything to appeal players it will die eventually
[9:41:19] <GODMIKEPMP> pubg and fortnite is not real competitive FPS
[9:41:34] <fredwicke> once there is a serious contender for a competitive FPS, then maybe it will die, until then
[9:41:36] <Whofednami> ^
[9:41:47] <sabensilverxd> but they take money for this game
[9:41:55] <+dksumo> semi pri in 1.5 dont make me laugh so hard. .
[9:41:57] <sabensilverxd> trading is ded xd
[9:41:58] <Zlidyh5> Rts like sc2 died, why cant csgo by that logic
[9:41:59] <tomwyr_> sure but ppl won't watch competitive esports if they have no intereset in the game
[9:42:00] <crisis_christ> pubg as competitive. LUL so much random
[9:42:08] <GODMIKEPMP> I think Valve might do something soon to appeal cause there is literally no 5v5 competitive fps to watch in the market
[9:42:12] <+eltemplario23> yea crisis
[9:42:14] <fredwicke> @BobVegana if true, then you sound like me, remember six shooter with a scope in beta? say whaaaaa
[9:42:15] <sabensilverxd> yes
[9:42:23] <GODMIKEPMP> or play for that matter
[9:42:36] <GODMIKEPMP> battalion 1944 dead cod series was trash since vanilla
[9:42:57] <GODMIKEPMP> pubg unbearable to watch but fun to play
[9:43:03] <crisis_christ> CoD mW = best cod. Coolest competitive (
[9:43:25] <+eltemplario23> cod=shit
[9:43:26] <crisis_christ> 2007 BibleThump
[9:43:39] <sabensilverxd> but pubg is very tactical game, people plays cs beacuse they dont think so much :D
[9:43:54] <JOHN_GORE> i hope riot's FPS actually is a CS clone geared for skill
[9:43:55] <sabensilverxd> cs is fun
[9:44:18] <sabensilverxd> but r6ss is very tactical

[10:22:56] <FantasySK> true
[10:23:36] <+wusoesports> so what's everyone up to
[10:23:44] <fredwicke> but in this tournament kenny > oskar
[10:23:58] <jdubbyaa> getting ready for work
[10:23:58] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[10:24:20] <SoulAnime> ChrisJ won some peeks vs kenny on dust and I think he's a much better match than oskar
[10:24:24] <jdubbyaa> :(
[10:24:32] <march526> where is Shox?
[10:24:33] <fredwicke> agreed @SoulAnime
[10:24:35] <pandinhafire> frenchs team are all shit
[10:24:39] <+Fr3shGy> @infamous_andrew thats a lie :(
[10:25:02] <%Kettedio> whens faze v c9?
[10:25:04] <SoulAnime> if my memory isn't bad chrisj was one of the best awpers in the scene for a while right?
[10:25:09] <ZuplaXD> 3
[10:25:12] <+Borussia8> When does live coverage start chat
[10:25:24] <+infamous_andrew> chrisj is one of the smartest awpers yes
[10:25:24] <ZuplaXD> Favela > Eua
[10:25:46] <fredwicke> i wouldn't say best, but he was/is good, normally secondary awp to oskar but has played better than oskar recently
[10:25:58] <pandinhafire> ntc >>> g2/astra LUL
[10:25:58] <+ZaneReichley> @Kettedio lready happened last night, faze won 2-0
[10:26:04] <SoulAnime> yeah that's what I mean at this point he has probably the most information about awping of players still in pro teams and they have oskar awping like why
[10:26:05] <+Borussia8> Chat when does live start
[10:26:13] <Ididntnotice> JW awping is hilarious tho
[10:26:24] <fat_sped> in about 5 hours
[10:26:36] <+wusoesports> jw got fucked by awp nerf tho
[10:26:40] <+Fr3shGy> because oscar is a beast prob. top 3 awpers right now
[10:26:50] <fredwicke> i dont know @SoulAnime old habits die hared i suppose
[10:26:54] <+Borussia8> T fn
[10:26:56] <+curryisle> and oscar hates to awp
[10:27:01] <fredwicke> @Fr3shGy not in this tournament

[10:27:34] <SoulAnime> "Hey oskar wanna awp" "nah I don't like it let chrisj" "okay oskar you're awping"
[10:28:13] <fredwicke> hah, right @SoulAnime and @Fr3shGy yes, slump doesn't mean dead and there's still more games to play since mouz wins this
[10:28:39] <fredwicke> oh snap, there's oskar doing something FINALLY
[10:28:42] <SoulAnime> yeah I'm not saying he isn't good I'm just saying if you're not using 2 awps let chrisj since oskar prefers rifles anyways

[10:52:51] <swedenko> resttOk
[10:52:53] <timsutim> why not?
[10:53:35] <fredwicke> it filled the seats at the arena and people still watched it
[10:53:36] <+curryisle> because in brazil i fear the favela's and sydney i fear the women
[10:53:38] <+Fr3shGy> players jetlagged, 30k viewers max and australia doesnt even care about cs
[10:54:07] <PurpIeYoshi> its not like all US care about cs
[10:54:35] <+curryisle> whoops, thought this was a dota stream
[10:54:39] <timsutim> players from eu will still be jetlagged if played in the US lul
[10:54:40] <fredwicke> it's like baseball in japan, you guys don't understand it but people still love it there, same as cs in australia
[10:54:47] <+Fr3shGy> true but atleast they get decent viewernumbers
[10:55:18] <SoulAnime> @timsutim the point was that they're jetlagged and the aussie cs community... well there isn't one?

[10:56:24] <SoulAnime> forced to watch S-Class asians vs D-Class islanders :'(
[10:56:54] <timsutim> @SoulAnime there will always be some teams with jetlag. doens't matter where the tournament is located

[10:57:55] <SoulAnime> not the point tim the point is if you're going to jetlag the teams we already know will be possible winners AND go to a place where they don't care about a live event nearly as much as other areas

[11:01:39] <timsutim> if you scroll a little bit up
[11:01:40] <SoulAnime> right but if you host it in a hut in australia it's not hard to fill the seats

[11:03:57] <MagicMushrooom> ^
[11:04:45] <SoulAnime> they go where the state will use taxpayer dollars to build them a stadium so they can have 40k+ people watching
[11:04:46] <fredwicke> take a look at hockey with altanta trash moving to winnipeg, no fans in atlanta, move to winnipeg (where the fans of hockey are) and boom sellout seats all year long
[11:05:18] <fredwicke> no they dont, look at the islanders, they've changed standiums 3 times and are still in new york you tard

[11:15:44] <+Fr3shGy> and astralis vs nrg on overpass was Kreygasm
[11:15:44] <+Tidus_Gaming> IMO, cs wont die for many many years

[11:16:01] <MalchiorUncut> CSGO is still one of the biggest e sports watched, if not the biggest, its not dieing
[11:16:08] <fredwicke> if it stays stagnant like it has, then yes *eventually*. if they change things or release another cs
[11:16:10] <vox37> been playing cs for 15 years
[11:16:20] <fredwicke> then no, cs will be around forever
[11:16:20] <timsutim> @Tidus_Gaming i agree! i never loved csgo more than now :o
[11:16:21] <garrettty> they'll slowly rebuild OG CLG, and the rest of the major winners will scatter
[11:16:35] <+no_talent> CSGO survived the release of the R8, we good LUL
[11:16:59] <+Tidus_Gaming> i do feel like viewer base for CS is dying and that if valve doesn't actually start implementing some of the ideas that the pro's are asking for it will die very very slowly tho
[11:17:12] <+tehnatedog> @no_talent truu
[11:17:16] <WhiteBoy322> fast ctmre
[11:17:17] <FourlomGames> That just isn't reflected in stats tho
[11:17:23] <garrettty> they had like 1.2 mil viewers for the boston major
[11:17:26] <+no_talent> actually the facebook streams is the dumbest shit in recent time
[11:17:36] <garrettty> watchu mean
[11:17:38] <FourlomGames> Viewing is at all time high just more tournaments
[11:17:40] <Werewolfmecha> yes!
[11:17:51] <vox37> facebook streams are so bad
[11:17:56] <+Tidus_Gaming> garretty that is a major, where are the viewers when a major isn't going on?
[11:18:00] <+no_talent> who the fk is watching on facebook like come on
[11:18:14] <garrettty> @no_talent agreed. they're default UI for facebook livestreams is so shitty
[11:18:19] <fredwicke> agreed @Tidus_Gaming
[11:18:24] <FourlomGames> Also, most stats don't include Chinese viewers who make up a large number
[11:18:28] <CnoWes> rock
[11:18:31] <garrettty> *their
[11:19:00] <vox37> astra vs faze final
[11:19:09] <timsutim> But what can they do to sprouse CSGO up? i cant think of anything
[11:19:23] <+Fr3shGy> new maps
[11:19:35] <statusonlin3> they need the map tuscan
[11:19:49] <vox37> bring back cpl_mill
[11:19:51] <timsutim> the maps they released are absolute dogshit
[11:19:55] <garrettty> @Tidus_Gaming I see what you're saying. A lot of tournaments get low viewership due to oversasturation, but they still have thousands of viewers, and the bigger tournies and majors have hundreds of thousands
[11:19:56] <FourlomGames> You don't necessarily want new maps, standard of cs will go down because people aren't as accustomed to new maps
[11:19:56] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[11:20:03] <+Tidus_Gaming> my only current complaint with CS right now are pistols, i feel they are too OP.. CZ's need a nerf, tec9 needs a small fix to spam spray pattern... they should rarely win a fight with an actual ak / m4
[11:20:21] <FourlomGames> SMG + Pistol movement speed?
[11:20:37] <vox37> pistols are fine
[11:20:52] <+Fr3shGy> CZ not ...
[11:20:54] <FourlomGames> movement speed would prevent insane strafe prefires and make fights more in favour of rifles
[11:21:40] <jimjam4real> cz7good
[11:21:48] <+Tidus_Gaming> lol vox you must be one that uses pistols more than rifles if you say that
[11:21:56] <garrettty> @Tidus_Gaming yep. Someone on a 60 Hz monitor with AK vs someone on 144Hz with CZ running will win that fight 9/10 times
[11:21:59] <+Tidus_Gaming> must be a CZ master lol
[11:22:19] <garrettty> the battle of monitors, frames, and weapon exploitation
[11:22:41] <garrettty> and it's still the most competitive shooter in e sports!
[11:23:01] <timsutim> that is true garretty.. but dont most people by now have 120+ hz monitors? PogChamp
[11:23:07] <vox37> cz has a 24 bullets. 100 dollaes a kill.
[11:23:12] <FourlomGames> tbf tho at high level pro games frames and monitors have no effect
[11:23:22] <FourlomGames> level playing field
[11:23:33] <vox37> i play 75hz
[11:23:41] <+Fr3shGy> overwatch fordnight best FortOne
[11:23:51] <+treesman5> did i miss the rerun or did it just styart?
[11:23:57] <FourlomGames> Genuinely save up for 144 Hz makes huge difference
[11:24:02] <timsutim> you missed i 6x times treesman6
[11:24:12] <vox37> na.
[11:24:13] <timsutim> it*
[11:24:18] <+treesman5> damn lol
[11:24:41] <vox37> play other games so 2k 75hz is fine for me
[11:24:43] <Jinxarnx> devve <3
[11:24:52] <FourlomGames> fair
[11:25:03] <timsutim> even old 120hz monitors is a huge upgrade.. you can buy used benq's for no money

[11:41:10] <SikxSicxSix> Faze up! Xist down :(
[11:41:21] <fredwicke> astralis will win this @moose you TURD
[11:41:57] <Moose0293> Its a rerun
[11:41:59] <SikxSicxSix> Thats what he said, lol
[11:42:13] <SikxSicxSix> also ^
[11:42:17] <+fruityKiting> no he did not, lol
[11:42:20] <+Fr3shGy> astralis always good in groupstage ...but semis/finals ..maybe
[11:42:37] <Moose0293> they just won the last cup like last week
[11:42:50] <Moose0293> they will play just as well
[11:43:01] <+Fr3shGy> first time since 1 year
[11:43:06] <Moose0293> if they beat fnatic in the semi its an ez win
[11:43:26] <Moose0293> because they will either play tyloo or faze
[11:44:10] <Moose0293> golden looks like harry potter
[11:44:32] <+Fr3shGy> izi for astralis only navi seems to be able to beat them
[11:44:33] <fredwicke> yea, too bad he's not magical in this game
[11:44:34] <SikxSicxSix> I wouldn't say Faze is an easy win ever, but tyloo yeah
[11:44:44] <Moose0293> no golden is bad
[11:44:49] <SikxSicxSix> and yeah Golden is a nerd for sure
[11:45:15] <fredwicke> we agree then, golden is bad and looks like harry potter in year 2
[11:45:19] <SikxSicxSix> Golden is good, I saw him clutch several rounds against mous
[11:45:21] <Moose0293> I personally think faze always fall last hurdle and tyloo have suprised everyone so far but I think taking on Australis is too much
[11:45:43] <Moose0293> because its mous there terrible XD
[11:45:58] <SikxSicxSix> honestly depends on Niko and rain, Guardian always shows up in top form
[11:46:08] <fredwicke> mouz isn't terrible, just haven't played well at this tournament
[11:46:14] <Moose0293> could be worse you could be navi
[11:46:25] <+Fr3shGy> would be sick faze vs astralis in final ...karrigan vs old team
[11:46:31] <Moose0293> Mous has a too small of a map pool to win trophies
[11:46:43] <SikxSicxSix> are you kidding? mouz and navi terrible?

[11:47:23] <+Fr3shGy> but he always turns up sodaH

[11:48:14] <young_man100> are these scrims?
[11:48:20] <+tastyeggss> I think u need like at least 2 if not 3 world class players to be a top team in cs nowadays
[11:48:29] <Moose0293> yeah
[11:48:44] <itsSPM> Mete o MAREGA!!!
[11:48:48] <Moose0293> good thing Australis has 5 XD
[11:48:55] <SikxSicxSix> No one gives Flamie the time of day when the dude is a top player no doubt
[11:49:00] <Moose0293> thats whats scary about them
[11:49:13] <+tastyeggss> Flamie pretty good, simple is world class

[11:50:00] <godlikepmp> how long does a player have to be washed up before they aren't world class anymore?

[11:50:32] <Moose0293> In current cs not long

[13:09:22] <Stickittotheman666> Thank Mr karjbee
[13:09:49] <Rommlel> who is the best player in the world?
[13:09:51] <+Lemon_Joy> some streams can not be watched
[13:10:08] <Pietaart123> ChrisJ
[13:10:16] <Moose0293> @Rommlel S1mple
[13:10:37] <Stickittotheman666> Simple
[13:10:52] <+Lemon_Joy> omg
[13:10:54] <Rommlel> true
[13:11:04] <abhi_lostgamer4> simple right now niko is upthere as well
[13:11:12] <Moose0293> s1mple can use a rifle or a pistol just as good as an awp not many players can pull that off at his level
[13:11:23] <+Lemon_Joy> shroud would kill them all
[13:11:27] <abhi_lostgamer4> looks like device has got his touch back
[13:11:48] <+Lemon_Joy> device is touching people? wut
[13:11:48] <CiortasVelnias> Niko
[13:11:55] <abhi_lostgamer4> Shroud is better than ninja dont abuse me ninja fans
[13:11:58] <Rommlel> but the best player is obviously boombl4
[13:12:12] <+Lemon_Joy> ninja is annoying but really good at fortnite
[13:12:17] <lucholet> the pc is broke i thought
[13:12:22] <CiortasVelnias> Csgo have like 3 or more players in that position such like Coldzera/Niko
[13:12:26] <+Lemon_Joy> KQLY is best imo
[13:12:34] <Moose0293> boombl4 was so good in the major I had to get his holo stickers from the major on my ak XD
[13:12:48] <Moose0293> Not coldzera

[16:10:34] <khalexinia> he should ask shroud for a tiket to pubg

[16:11:23] <+Fr3shGy> sodaMONK 🚬
[16:11:32] <iThinkImJacob> I think shroud should stay out of competitive gaming. He’s great at CS and Pubg, but I think he’s better off just by himself playing with just9n or chad or whoever

[16:12:08] <khalexinia> he had awesome plays
[16:12:10] <Mrfibbles> ayyyy no need for flac being thrown around he could have something going in IRl effecting his gam play and we afent there to know. meaning playing in this tournament
[16:12:59] <iThinkImJacob> I’m not saying that he was an issue or wasn’t a great player, I just think he’s better off without being in a team.

[16:13:32] <+Sh4rd7> !sceduel

[16:14:58] <Mrfibbles> compared to how he seems to be as a "person" and his "personality" ,but again outside perspective so i have no idea . maybe he had the time of his life ans didn't wnt to ruin that experience so "retired"
