[3:02:24] <pewiestiffin> nope
[3:03:19] <+BigMacIron> Just the awkward remarks are triggering me wixHYPER
[3:03:54] <pewiestiffin> Kappa
[3:04:00] <+xceebsx> Such as @bigmaciron
[3:04:37] <+BigMacIron> I'll tell ya as they happen
[3:07:38] <+xceebsx> Are there contracts for esports and can people leave and play for other teams and get traded
[3:08:29] <Jordansummers777> Usually team contracts
[3:08:56] <+xceebsx> But can players get traded? Like nba or mlb type trades
[3:08:58] <Jordansummers777> And when a contract gets close to expiration’s players either look for a new team or re sign for the team they play for
[3:09:10] <Javielosky75> now
[3:09:15] <Jordansummers777> Usually it’s like a pool
[3:09:26] <+xceebsx> Wdym by pool
[3:09:28] <Jordansummers777> teams pull when they think a player isn’t producing from the team
[3:09:42] <Jordansummers777> And get a new one from a old pro players
[3:10:14] <+xceebsx> So for instance liquid has more than 5 players for csgo?
[3:10:34] <Jordansummers777> Shroud is still signed to cloud 9 I believe but he doesn’t play cs anymore and they signed Tarik and steel I believe
[3:10:50] <Jordansummers777> So technically yes
[3:11:09] <+xceebsx> What’re the top three esports teams for csgo right now
[3:11:59] <Jordansummers777> I do not know haven’t been following the pro scene lately because of school and work
[3:12:23] <Jordansummers777> Probably faze , sk , cloud 9
[3:13:08] <Jordansummers777> Just saying it’s hard to say top 3 teams because it changes rapidly
[3:13:16] <+xceebsx> Yeah I understand
[3:13:34] <+xceebsx> How long ago did shroud stop playing? And is he kinda known as the best?
[3:14:00] <TheDark00700> TRUMP #MAGA

[3:15:29] <Jordansummers777> Around atleast 6 months
[3:15:48] <Jordansummers777> Between six months and a year
[3:16:03] <Jordansummers777> He is know as one of the craziest players of all time
[3:16:20] <Jordansummers777> He was a very consistent player
[3:16:39] <+xceebsx> Did ninja ever play csgo for LG?
[3:16:39] <Jordansummers777> And known for showing little emotion or reactions in games
[3:16:50] <Jordansummers777> No
[3:17:05] <+xceebsx> Just halo h1 and pubg
[3:18:22] <Jordansummers777> I believe so
[3:18:33] <pewiestiffin> this comeback is coming
[3:23:34] <+xceebsx> If you don’t have armor will any gun one shot you to the head
[3:25:25] <+Crypt1cGaming> no but depending on the distance it can be
[3:27:12] <+xceebsx> Like how does renegades lose there against pistols? Was it renegades being bad or liquid being that good
[3:27:45] <MasonBolton> y not both?
[3:27:56] <+s10thking> timing is everything @xceebsx
[3:32:38] <+xceebsx> How hard was that shot to hit
[3:33:15] <+Crypt1cGaming> why is my messages deleted

[3:43:19] <+xceebsx> Wow
[3:43:39] <+xceebsx> Yeah this commentator loves Renegades
[3:44:34] <MasonBolton> didn't he say before he watches nearly all liquids matches cos he thinks there one of the best?
[3:44:58] <+xceebsx> I think so yea
[3:46:29] <MasonBolton> so doesn't that mean he loves both teams not just renegades?
[3:46:38] <+xceebsx> Does it go best to worst from top to bottom on team names
[3:47:00] <+xceebsx> I wasn’t saying he only like renegades just that he’s talking about them a lot more
[3:47:40] <MasonBolton> because there's alot more to talk about
[3:47:46] <+TheRealKeyIsMe> honestly don't like this guy's casting style
[3:47:59] <+xceebsx> Whys that mason
[3:48:24] <MasonBolton> because they're making the most plays
[3:48:51] <+xceebsx> This is just where I’m ignorant in this game especially esports play of csgo

[3:50:08] <+xceebsx> Don’t have a good pc to run games only a PS4
[3:50:27] <+xceebsx> I’m a console pleb :(
[3:50:42] <youwishenlol> Because for some reason I can only play one game CS GO, then following games lag A LOT
[3:50:50] <MasonBolton> my pc is one of the worst and it runs fine. plus I feel ya. I used to play ps4
[3:50:53] <youwishenlol> Like, I get 30 FPS. First game +100

[4:15:38] <+xceebsx> Does armor carry over
[4:17:49] <hypersonicpeanut_yt> ??
[4:19:09] <MasonBolton> if u don't die
[4:19:14] <SkullyFX> yes ,anything carries over that you buy/ pick up
[4:20:01] <+xceebsx> So it’s actually pretty crucial of a guy dies at the end who had armor bc they’ll have to buy that and a gun
[4:20:41] <MasonBolton> yes and the money u spent is wasted
[4:20:42] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[4:20:51] <SkullyFX> exactly

[4:21:58] <+xceebsx> Like right there giving that guy the ak
[4:22:14] <+xceebsx> At the end of the round
[4:22:21] <MasonBolton> yes
[4:23:16] <MasonBolton> if u have enough money for 2 guns but a person on ur team can't buy then u can buy a gun for them and then buy for urself
[4:23:54] <justen523> wtf
[4:24:07] <+xceebsx> This game seems more team based than cod search and destroy. Do people play pub matches with fandoms?

[10:14:57] <mantikless> is he injured
[10:14:59] <knock0uts4s> csgo is goin down due to the cheating community, i would love to have insurance that no1 is cheating when i play but that's not gonna happen
[10:15:10] <knock0uts4s> and yes i d
[10:15:17] <mantikless> where did he fall from
[10:15:35] <knock0uts4s> tried faceit and others with anticheat but i wanna play compet and reach my true skill
[10:15:35] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[10:16:12] <knock0uts4s> why is it so hard for valve to create an anticheat maaaan
[10:16:49] <mantikless> they need someone like mr. robot for a good anti-cheat lol
[10:17:27] <knock0uts4s> so you're telling me that faceit are able to do it and valve cant do it for their own game lol
[10:18:36] <mantikless> there are hacks in faceit too, but those morons who pay money for hacks dont usually play in faceit premium ive heard
[10:18:37] <knock0uts4s> i think they are just ignorant and don't care about the community over all only where money is made which is the pro scene

[10:20:11] <knock0uts4s> thats why people are quitting csgo and start playing fortnite/pubg because they can play the game aa it should be

[13:11:03] <+saldom_moblas> lies
[13:11:07] <+proxy_caducado> cloud9 will win
[13:11:14] <greg0092> CSGO is for league of legends players without strategic intelligence LUL
[13:11:19] <+saldom_moblas> its a rerun lmao
[13:11:21] <Sppazz> I'm prime
[13:11:34] <+migmedic> LMFAO LOL is a terrible game
[13:11:39] <+yry001215> the prob is not the cheaters, but rather cheaters cont get caught, and cheaters got his teammate to cover him
[13:11:43] <Sppazz> true^
[13:11:45] <+Yahweehh> you know better player ? must be a cheater LUL
[13:11:54] <+saldom_moblas> true
[13:11:54] <greg0092> LoL is a great game
[13:12:04] <+saldom_moblas> never played it
[13:12:05] <Sppazz> LoL is trash
[13:12:07] <greg0092> however LoL is a shiet game if you're not dedicated
[13:12:18] <greg0092> it
[13:12:22] <Sppazz> Click to move is for casualas
[13:12:27] <+yry001215> It could be great if i started playing it the moment its released LUL
[13:12:27] <+migmedic> csgo is a way better game than lol
[13:12:28] <+WoutIsRaar> Fortnite is the best game atm in my opinion
[13:12:30] <+saldom_moblas> hmm
[13:12:31] <schiroptera2> Stewie BibleThump
[13:12:35] <greg0092> it's trash if you're trash at it
[13:12:41] <+yry001215> but with that many heros well not greate for me
[13:12:44] <Sppazz> Nah i wasn't trash
[13:12:57] <Sppazz> I just don't like click to move
[13:13:13] <+yry001215> cs1.6 is the best game of all time imo
[13:13:19] <+migmedic> dota2 is better than lol
[13:13:25] <+saldom_moblas> so its trash? lmao
[13:13:33] <Sppazz> yes
[13:13:39] <+yry001215> ikr, click to move works better on phones or ipads
[13:13:41] <greg0092> even though it's a click to move, it still requires way more mechanical skill
[13:13:44] <Sppazz> Dogshit*

[13:14:06] <greg0092> LoL>CSGO and i dont even play LoL anymore
[13:14:12] <+migmedic> dude csgo is one of the highest skill ceiling games ever
[13:14:16] <+ivoryy1> kjljjk
[13:14:30] <Sppazz> playing against 5 hackers in comp is better than LoL
[13:14:33] <+saldom_moblas> cyka
[13:14:39] <greg0092> @migmedic far from LOL, it's a pretty basic game in terms of skill requirement
[13:14:50] <+saldom_moblas> h
[13:14:54] <greg0092> things like starcraft and LoL is way more complex in every aspect
[13:15:01] <Sppazz> It's not hard to click the ground and use the 5 abilites
[13:15:13] <UnBrokenStreams> ^
[13:15:16] <hobotheglorious> @greg0092 basic in theory
[13:15:21] <+Yahweehh> lmao
[13:15:23] <+yry001215> it matters whether its fun
[13:15:24] <greg0092> so its hard to WASD around?
[13:15:28] <+saldom_moblas> just the tip KappaPride
[13:15:34] <greg0092> why should it be harder to WASD around, than clicking
[13:15:35] <+migmedic> greg LOL requires a knowledge of champs and thats it. csgo is so mechanical
[13:15:42] <+yry001215> hard or ez does not matter if the game itself it not fun
[13:15:43] <+Yahweehh> why aren't you guys pro players you could make a lot of money ... it is so ez to click and use 4 skills LUL
[13:15:45] <+migmedic> youre delusional
[13:15:59] <greg0092> LoL is also mechanichal, however it's more strategic indeed
[13:16:07] <hobotheglorious> csgo is simple but at pro levels the skill ceiling is insane
[13:16:09] <greg0092> mechanical*
[13:16:21] <greg0092> so is LoL
[13:16:25] <Sppazz> Greg at your bracket it's just mongloid
[13:16:27] <+Yahweehh> if you say lol is not mechanical you are probably bronze 5
[13:16:36] <+easySleeps> RIP C(
[13:16:36] <greg0092> @Yahweehh word
[13:16:38] <UnBrokenStreams> No way it’s not strategic

[1 day, 7:11:48] <cakethedelicious> new to csgo, can you get skins for free or is it all from opening crates?
[1 day, 7:12:16] <robert_dragon> @cakethedelicious they say you can get free skins, but in very rare cases.
[1 day, 7:12:16] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[1 day, 7:12:31] <cakethedelicious> damn alrighty
[1 day, 7:12:57] <robert_dragon> @cakethedelicious by cases i mean ways. not crates whatever
[1 day, 7:13:29] <Yunnerd> i think you can get free skins by leveling up
[1 day, 7:13:48] <Yunnerd> but theyre mostly crap tho
[1 day, 7:14:00] <MrShaunMAn> at certain ranks you get drops
[1 day, 7:14:03] <robert_dragon> ^
[1 day, 7:14:24] <MrShaunMAn> doest have to be crap but mostly is
[1 day, 7:14:33] <cakethedelicious> i see
[1 day, 7:14:40] <hellter777> valve drops skins RANDOMLY mostly....and when you rank up your profile (NOT the competitive skill though)
[1 day, 7:14:47] <bekir_bilgehan_tekin> csgo bitti bitti
[1 day, 7:15:14] <robert_dragon> @cakethedelicious go to the church, pray to god, play a csgo match and ure gonna get a dlore
[1 day, 7:15:14] <hellter777> valve does NOT give skins for ranking up in competitive skill, EVER!
[1 day, 7:15:34] <MrShaunMAn> noone said that
[1 day, 7:15:37] <hellter777> vavlve sucks big time, as it always did....they only care about money
[1 day, 7:16:15] <GriffPlay> true
[1 day, 7:16:16] <robert_dragon> @hellter777 same as riot games
[1 day, 7:16:33] <hellter777> yeah....same as all companies actually
[1 day, 7:16:37] <uzulass> valve created steam
[1 day, 7:16:43] <robert_dragon> not really
[1 day, 7:16:50] <hellter777> no?
[1 day, 7:17:06] <robert_dragon> i mean
[1 day, 7:17:18] <Seccess> It was gaben, not valve Kappa
[1 day, 7:17:19] <+william17001> WutFace
[1 day, 7:17:24] <robert_dragon> i dont think i can give u an example. but probably not every single company is the same
[1 day, 7:17:28] <enjoyragequit> rip csgo
[1 day, 7:17:44] <Seccess> Yeah, who made steam is just such a complex situation
[1 day, 7:17:48] <MrShaunMAn> riot balances champs depending on their esports influence. many champs unbalanced
[1 day, 7:18:04] <hellter777> yeah, small companies always try to compete with big ones and sometimes they do that respecting the game and players, that is true
[1 day, 7:18:30] <robert_dragon> @MrNinja33_ just got into a game. im against an yi which will prob rush guinsoo and then one shot everybody
[1 day, 7:18:54] <robert_dragon> @MrShaunMAn * xd
[1 day, 7:19:31] <MrShaunMAn> i have like 2500 hours in lol. lost my mind in last 6 months. now im on csgo and im like a new person. quit lol while you can
[1 day, 7:19:33] <robert_dragon> @MrShaunMAn did some tickets at riot some time ago. they just copy paste their replies to the tickets. and they literally said that they dont xd
[1 day, 7:19:37] <uzulass> Steam is a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation, straing from wikipedia
[1 day, 7:22:15] <MrShaunMAn> @robert_dragon sad that i realised it too late. but getting mad cuz of a game is not good xd. someone feeds and you spend 30 mins in a game just so you can start new and maybe win
[1 day, 7:22:18] <Seccess> can they just start? I don't really care about this tea party from 2017
[1 day, 7:23:47] <hellter777> oh, God, Seccess does not care about 2017 tea party....ESL should IMMEDIATLY stream something else, guys....Seccess here is like some kind of a arogant boss....he/she should be URGENTLY pleased
[1 day, 7:24:42] <mataloxxl> SK is finally falling
[1 day, 7:25:00] <uzulass> they have allready fallen
[1 day, 7:25:08] <hellter777> @SEccess Please write to production your prefferences so they know what to stream and what not to in the future
[1 day, 7:25:39] <hellter777> @seccess Also write to IEM, DREAMHACK and so on....so they schedule matches and teams to YOUR liking
[1 day, 7:26:22] <hellter777> so many arogant pricks in the world....i can't believe my eyes
[1 day, 7:26:42] <MrShaunMAn> @hellter777 so you have to be a prick too?
[1 day, 7:26:51] <mataloxxl> 21st century ..
[1 day, 7:27:12] <Seccess> @hellter777 Wow, trigger of the year
[1 day, 7:27:17] <hellter777> unfortunetly...yeah :( it's a character defect i have
[1 day, 7:27:29] <Seccess> Never seen anyone so triggered
[1 day, 7:27:58] <MrShaunMAn> @hellter777 more like a brain defect
[1 day, 7:28:13] <hellter777> yeah...the crain determines character
[1 day, 7:28:23] <Seccess> But really though, they should skip this match, i want to see Nip vs NOA from 2004 instead
[1 day, 7:28:51] <hellter777> as i said....
[1 day, 7:28:59] <mataloxxl> noone is interested in cs 1.6 and cs:s
[1 day, 7:29:00] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[1 day, 7:29:25] <hellter777> i am....css was, in my humble opinion, the best cs ever
[1 day, 7:29:48] <Seccess> Because you were too young to have played 1.6 then
[1 day, 7:30:11] <hellter777> but hey....that does NOT mean the world should get back to it....what I care about and what I like is just me....at least I accept that
[1 day, 7:30:49] <hellter777> i am 32 years old....i played cs 1.6 as well....i just hated it for being able to shoot through walls
[1 day, 7:31:10] <Seccess> Well, Vanilla wow is coming back, so you're wrong, if you voice your opinion, you may create a weave :)
[1 day, 7:31:22] <mataloxxl> why would you play 1.6 when u have go
[1 day, 7:31:24] <hellter777> again, that is just me....people like wallbanging....i don't....but I won't go on complaining about it
[1 day, 7:31:27] <Seccess> You didn't like that people with IQ could wallbang you?
[1 day, 7:31:38] <MrShaunMAn> you're probably still single? i mean with that attitude..
[1 day, 7:32:01] <hellter777> me, single?
[1 day, 7:32:13] <Seccess> Yeah, you're single. Don't argue it
[1 day, 7:32:17] <hellter777> yeah, my wife just left me :))))))))
[1 day, 7:32:18] <Bynky> why so toxic people
[1 day, 7:32:39] <MrShaunMAn> i wonder why..
[1 day, 7:32:52] <hellter777> i dunno Bynky, i am only having fun here
[1 day, 7:33:42] <Seccess> You verbally assaulted me, if that's your idea of fun, you should look at the dictionary's definition of fun and reevaluate that statement
[1 day, 7:33:55] <Bynky> whats the fun in needlessly arguing in twitch chat w strangers
[1 day, 7:34:09] <mataloxxl> lol chat off bye
[1 day, 7:34:22] <MrShaunMAn> +he's 32.. xd
[1 day, 7:34:54] <hellter777> verbaly assaulted? ufff, i was just trying to make a point....965 people accepted what ESL streams right now....but you couldn't
[1 day, 7:35:42] <Seccess> To translate what i said to you. It would be nice if they edited out the talking, and jumped into the match.. WOW, what an outrageous thing to say..
[1 day, 7:35:52] <hellter777> and that is ok, not being a part of the flock....but hey, you don't like, hit the 'x' button and go watch smth else

[1 day, 9:12:22] <+forrestwilson> though
[1 day, 9:12:28] <Fiskerz> The fact that someone can ruin/lose their whole career/life in 2018 by saying one word is such a joke.
[1 day, 9:12:59] <+StanleyBallz> China
[1 day, 9:13:00] <+forrestwilson> so i get that he said something offensive, but what was the context. what happened?
[1 day, 9:13:02] <Fiskerz> A world that half the population can say and there is no problem and the other half just loses their whole career. What a joke

[1 day, 9:43:52] <anotherfancyusername> also the casters are a tight group, they have a monopoly over big events
[1 day, 9:44:11] <anotherfancyusername> maybe... that could be
[1 day, 9:44:31] <Tasticsowns> i think i'd stay away from my twitter account for at least 2-3 days as well if something like that happened
