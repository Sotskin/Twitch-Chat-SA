[1:59:25] <patrezzz6767> Age Of Empires and C&C Red Alerts need to be remastered
[1:59:26] <Bengammon> the plane one and the sword battles my god that was fun
[1:59:26] <+L1RPHX> there was a matrix knockoff mod built on the original half life engine. called "The Specialist". it was like counter strike but with karate, diving, and bullet time.
[1:59:33] <+Hol3yduck> @esl_csgo no armor on Weber?
[1:59:36] <+thecuriousturtle> @quinnzeskimo ya too bad we don't see that uniqueness today as much
[1:59:51] <+thecuriousturtle> @L1RPHX that sounds nuts lol
[1:59:53] <+JsMkayy> wtf
[1:59:53] <patrezzz6767> and Redneck Rampage that was dope
[2:00:07] <+O_R_A_N_G_E_J_U_I_C_E> lets go radix lets go
[2:00:11] <+L1RPHX> @thecuriousturtle it was like my favorite game for a long time. it was sick.
[2:00:24] <+Ruthless937> is hype a 12 year old?
[2:00:30] <quinnzeskimo> @thecuriousturtle cause it wont sell billions of copies like a reskinned COD game
[2:00:32] <Bengammon> age of empires looks nice i think with its simplistic graphics i dont think they should remaster it maybe re release it but dont change it

[2:00:40] <+Ruthless937> who puts EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE after their name other than 12 year olds?
[2:00:45] <+thecuriousturtle> @quinnzeskimo truest statement
[2:01:10] <+Nyctef> @l1rphx oh shit I remember that
[2:01:30] <+Nyctef> It was awesome but I was terrible at it :D
[2:01:43] <+Ruthless937> @Bengammon theres no need to re release computer games.. you can just torrent any old game you want anyways
[2:01:44] <meramoer> Have Radix got rid of UK legends Ec1 and GOD Ardiis?
[2:02:47] <KeirRoberts6> chat=ded
[2:02:53] <+O_R_A_N_G_E_J_U_I_C_E> lol
[2:03:12] <+Ruthless937> i think if you remaster a game you should fix all the major bugs in the game and give it a graphics overhaul and bam done. KOTOR 2 remastered would be epic
[2:03:26] <CrysrtalFire> PopCorn
[2:03:42] <Bengammon> @Ruthless937 i know its on pc ive got it but i first played it on the ps2 it would just be nice to have it back on console
