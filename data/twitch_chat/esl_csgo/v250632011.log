[0:18:07] <Armory_6> Guess the giveaway is only for Australia and New Zealand
[0:18:26] <~ESL_CSGO> UK and IRE :)
[0:18:32] <realherbacide> shouldnt my fps be higher with a 144hz monitor i am only getting about 140 fps i have a 1050ti nvidia gpu so idk
[0:18:50] <riffylele> @realherbacide Csgo doesnt depend on your graphics card
[0:19:02] <realherbacide> cpu more less then?
[0:19:02] <riffylele> what processor are you rocking?
[0:19:26] <Armory_6> want to have at least 144 fps. need a better cpu. i have a gtx 660 and i still get 130 fps cause my cpu doesnt suck
[0:19:39] <realherbacide> am amd a10 7700k r7
[0:19:42] <sambradshaw95> @realherbacide not really, FPS is still going to be limited by your GPU, if your GPU can‚Äôt hit 144fps then you won‚Äôt see 144 FPS on your monitor, same as if you increase everything to max, your FPS will drop because your GPU is working harder
[0:19:44] <+s3nk4201> sup
[0:19:55] <inxsz> what's this song called
[0:20:08] <sambradshaw95> @inxsz shit
[0:20:11] <Fredrik_192> Darude - Sandstorm
[0:20:31] <inxsz> @sambradshaw95 That's your opinion and it doesn't matter
[0:20:34] <riffylele> Your cpu is a bit old i guess @realherbacide
[0:20:44] <Alpmar> this beat is sick
[0:20:54] <realherbacide> well i get 144 hz on my benq monitor but my fps has stayed the same from when i played on my 60 herz
[0:21:06] <JosefVonTreeHerder> @robiincsgohi
[0:21:08] <realherbacide> yeah i do have an older amd cpu
[0:21:09] <vitzzovick> YA YA YA YA THE TWO TIMES
[0:21:14] <Armory_6> a 1050 ti is fine for csgo on a 144hz monitor is you get a better cpu
[0:21:15] <riffylele> It is not like your monitor boosts your fps @realherbacide
[0:21:17] <realherbacide> a bit
[0:21:24] <idontknowmyname> hello
[0:21:33] <sambradshaw95> @realherbacide your FPS doesn‚Äôt matter relevant to@your monitor...
[0:21:33] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[0:21:36] <idontknowmyname> can we get drops from this?
[0:21:48] <inxsz> @Armory_6 CS runs with Intel HD family graphics with a semi-decent cpu
[0:21:54] <Alpmar> my pc is crapp bit ia, still a silver scout god ma duds
[0:21:57] <sambradshaw95> @realherbacide it‚Äôs down to what your cpu and GPU can kick out, if they aren‚Äôt capable of 144 you won‚Äôt get 144
[0:22:02] <realherbacide> well arent amd ryzen 7s like over 300$ or something???/
[0:22:18] <inxsz> amd LUL
[0:22:28] <Alpmar> amk ??
[0:22:29] <AbhiKudo> AMD FailFish
[0:22:31] <riffylele> @realherbacide If you really play only csgo then a ryzen isnt what you should get
[0:22:33] <Armory_6> @inxsz i know. im telling him he doesnt need to upgrade his gpu if he just gets a better cpu
[0:22:37] <idontknowmyname> I have the Intel I7-7740X, bought it to quickly kinda sad about it

[0:26:48] <idontknowmyname> can you get drops in premier
[0:26:54] <+Lakonic> cheapest 144hz monitor on amazon i saw was ¬£168
[0:26:58] <Armory_6> NO YOU CANT
[0:27:03] <idontknowmyname> ok haha
[0:27:17] <AbhiKudo> 168 is quite cheap
[0:27:19] <sambradshaw95> @abhikudo that was an AOC monitor
[0:27:21] <duucalori> nice
[0:27:24] <+tomcs_> AOC 144hz = ¬£300, asus = <¬£200
[0:27:29] <+H8BREEDERPRO> go eplsioN
[0:27:45] <AbhiKudo> is asus better than aoc? for monitors?

[0:28:32] <inxsz> ASUS>AOC
[0:28:34] <+1SASIN1> most are going to 240hrz now
[0:28:47] <+H8BREEDERPRO> aoc > asus
[0:28:56] <sambradshaw95> No need for 240hz for downtime gaming atm
[0:28:59] <+H8BREEDERPRO> ye u should go for 240
[0:29:12] <spikersan24> ? v ?
[0:29:14] <+1SASIN1> so if you can wait and save for 240
[0:29:23] <+H8BREEDERPRO> depends on how serious u take the gaming thou imo
[0:29:37] <AbhiKudo> but i dont think i will have enough money to get a GPU that can run 240FPS
[0:29:38] <+1SASIN1> 144 to 240 is big in cs
[0:29:46] <Armory_6> if you cant get that much fps dont bother getting the 240
[0:29:47] <+H8BREEDERPRO> yes it is
[0:29:48] <Atreidas> charlie 'pickles' pickles is going to give it in the interview and go 0.2hltv in the final
[0:29:54] <+1SASIN1> csgo is CPU based

[0:31:24] <skadewdles> JonCarnage
[0:31:26] <sambradshaw95> A lot more than 144
[0:31:27] <+H8BREEDERPRO> if u buying a new pc u should go all in imo and buy the best shit u possible can
[0:31:27] <ekarlssonn> lmfao
[0:31:38] <Armory_6> like $400-500

[0:32:57] <+H8BREEDERPRO> cs go is more about cpu then gpu
[0:33:05] <inxsz> @AbhiKudo It's not that a 1080ti can't, because it can. PUBG doesn't have support to run at 240hzx

[0:33:06] <Atreidas> Boaster is trying really hard not to piss himself laughing
[0:33:08] <+1SASIN1> threadripper would be as good as 6700 7700 8700 for cs
[0:33:10] <Armory_6> @abhikudo thats cause pubg was optimized for a trash can
