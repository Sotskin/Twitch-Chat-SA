[0:29:03] <mindless_deniz> playing with fns is like having a bot in team. seriously stewie was better
[0:29:04] <Masaasd> ez 4 tim
[0:29:25] <mindless_deniz> autimatic 6-1-0 0_0
[0:29:44] <+hidewak> yeah but stewie chose to leave
[0:29:44] <Tardedaresomodsre> unlike the baguettes, australians managed to show some exciting stuffs to the home fans
[0:30:06] <Glockateer> i never thought i would see fns on a cloud9 team
[0:30:15] <MagicMushrooom> Who won map 3 c0 or tyloo thanks if you reply :)
[0:30:22] <Glockateer> but that gives hope to all the legendary eagle players out there
[0:30:24] <flark2y> tyloo won 2-0
[0:30:25] <SirScrubs> c8
[0:30:28] <+el_chiche_> YTB
[0:30:30] <SycoGTA> Yeah. Stewie left, months after winning a Major, lmfao. FNS is a replacement because they lost a member they didnt drop him
[0:30:33] <daheroin3> there was no map 3
[0:30:35] <opkampitak> is cloud9 out?
[0:30:36] <MagicMushrooom> oh only 2 maps? yeah i saw

[0:31:12] <+fabian078_> @opkampitak no
[0:31:16] <SycoGTA> c9 is playing in 14 hours for lower bracket vs Order
[0:31:23] <+XMaster31415> eh
[0:31:29] <bonjwa_ga> @frederick99_ it’s cause it was a recent match
[0:31:30] <SycoGTA> its a best of 3. so if someone wins both frist games, a 3rd isnt needed.

[0:43:24] <ostriike> pubg > fornite yeah fornite is sucks
[0:43:29] <aran___> @mindless_deniz yea its annoying when you drop avg 25+ a game and everyone else has like 10
[0:43:33] <thejabroni> i don't think fortnite has a good comp setup, too wonky
[0:43:33] <+thewheatons95> true but it will niot be soon

[0:45:14] <StyleDtz> So happy SK lost with stewie
[0:45:38] <ExStrike> LUL
[0:45:41] <Glockateer> and popularity doesn't mean competitive esport. people watched starcraft 2 for a while and didn't even play it. the most skilled games might have little to no players
[0:45:46] <Juicy0> stewie is on trial still, no?
[0:45:53] <ExStrike> lrsnIDK
[0:45:54] <SycoGTA> @StyleDtz I agree, its almost as great as watching Hiko lose with any other team lmfao.

[0:47:28] <ExStrike> Its just because its a rerun tho
[0:47:30] <flark2y> because its a rerun tho :v

[0:48:08] <aran___> yea all the chilled out and non toxic people are on this stream right now
[0:48:15] <StyleDtz> Its crazy, Bntet is IGLing in both english and chinese while fragging out so hard

[0:48:23] <xarmanis15ii> 16-6
[0:48:26] <ExStrike> I wish people just were able to talk with eachother about the game
[0:48:28] <wallace_korea1> SK Bettors ! dammm fells bad for them
[0:48:36] <SycoGTA> might have a factor most of the toxic people are at school right now.
[0:48:42] <flark2y> agree
[0:48:42] <Glockateer> bntet is the mvp of the day 1 for sure
[0:48:52] <sprayzii> rerun :(
[0:48:52] <aran___> i wonder how nrg will do

[0:49:09] <connabear> 707
[0:49:10] <StyleDtz> NRG surprised me. I didn't think they would be so good
[0:49:12] <+Kratoffelstream> @ExStrike People cant even talk INGAME about the game in a proper manner
[0:49:15] <SycoGTA> NRG will destory BOOT 2-0

[0:50:34] <+bastianigs64> where can i see the next matches schedule?
[0:50:38] <ExStrike> C9 isnt that competitive as sk is (shrouds words)
[0:50:47] <first_froggy> bast i will message you it
[0:50:49] <SycoGTA> rumors were ska and stew didnt see eye to eye
[0:50:49] <aran___> i think SKs main problem is now they have to speak in english, when they were just only speaking in Portuguese
[0:51:12] <yeuem2000> Why Stew ?
[0:51:25] <Glockateer> sk is a well known world champion, i could understand how he wanted to see what its like
[0:51:27] <ExStrike> I think autimatic and tarik are great people to live with
[0:51:30] <flark2y> both wanted
[0:51:30] <StyleDtz> I want SK to lose with stewie in these events. I don't think C9 need stew back when they drop him
[0:51:46] <kimocsgo> @AranPowers they give info x2 eng and por
[0:51:46] <+SethRx> Rerun?
[0:51:49] <SycoGTA> they didnt drop him.. he left

[0:52:11] <imjustkawaii> did stewie leave or get dropped
[0:52:13] <SycoGTA> sure is, a live rerun.

[0:52:24] <flark2y> left
[0:52:29] <first_froggy> left @imjustkawaii
[0:52:31] <aran___> @kimocsgo oh ok but to me it seems like the communication but idk
[0:52:32] <StyleDtz> Stew chose to leave C9
[0:52:34] <SycoGTA> stewie wont be invited back, why would they invite him after him leaving form having issues?
[0:52:35] <PabloTheMangoYo> why are 11k ppl watching a rerun?
[0:52:43] <aldirsouza> tchurchuquei não precisa do C9 ja tem a SK, melhor do mundo.
[0:52:44] <flumpflumpflump> why are c9 playing grayhoud
[0:52:52] <first_froggy> sk sent out an offer to bother stewie and autimatic, stewie was the first to jump on the offer
[0:52:57] <flark2y> its in au
[0:53:00] <SycoGTA> yes lets break up a major winning team approx 1 month after winning, and then take the toxic player back.
[0:53:04] <ExStrike> Stll people trying to troll while were having a nice conversation lrsnFine
[0:53:04] <StyleDtz> C9 are also doing pretty good with FNS. His only problem is he can't really frag
[0:53:15] <flark2y> yeah lol
[0:53:16] <+martinnacka> @PabloTheMangoYo why are you watching? might be the same rteason 11k are watching :p
[0:53:17] <Skyserian> stewie2k left c9 to join sk, on his own, c9 org did not drop him
[0:53:23] <Glockateer> unless c9 plays utterly terrible on day2, they will probably tryout fns longer than 1 event
[0:53:31] <Gaussfire> @StyleDtz he's got a nasty pistol tho ;)
[0:53:36] <Glockateer> but what do i know
[0:53:39] <callmeliam> !results
[0:53:50] <Skyserian> pretty sure fns will stay on c9 for quite a few months minimum
[0:53:50] <aran___> @PabloTheMangoYo its because the event happened in Australia and over there its around 2 am so when the events were on its was night everywhere else

[2:28:40] <+VicLara> it's a RERUN
[2:28:47] <prfct420> Bet ure a girl
[2:29:02] <+Tribu1982> @Jacen_xD where do you watch those games? :)
[2:29:16] <BattleBrowler> How can it be RERUN if its live? Wrong headline?
[2:29:18] <+Davido03> Women can't play CS properly, FACT.
[2:29:32] <+Meanwhile916> earch woens esl
[2:29:32] <prfct420> Racist
[2:29:36] <+CrotShot> the stream is live....they are just streaming a rerun
[2:29:42] <+VicLara> it's a live broadcast of a past game
[2:29:51] <+Jacen_xD> @Tribu1982 its hard to find those games on twitch unless you follow the womens scene but you can also watch the demos on hltv
[2:29:55] <+VicLara> it's not that hard to understand =]
[2:30:14] <georgi808> he is trolling boys
[2:30:32] <+Tribu1982> @Felix_Marsh proff of what? that girls ant as good as boys in CSgo?
[2:30:43] <Enderdragon911> Nay

[2:31:34] <+Tribu1982> @Felix_Marsh maybe mentality maybe something els.. but you show me some of the girls in the top 20 teams..
[2:31:38] <+VicLara> i believe that girls are just as good, but less interested. So they do not dedicate their time as much as we do
[2:31:46] <+Tribu1982> @Felix_Marsh top 50? just a single girl player
[2:32:04] <+Davido03> Calling them girls and not women, is all you need to know...FailFish
[2:32:06] <Enderdragon911> Gamers rise up!
[2:32:51] <+VicLara> girls becouse gamers are usually very young, that's all
[2:32:53] <LonelyLeftHand> @Tribu1982 dude @VicLara Disproved your argument already.
[2:32:59] <Jkt84> So passive FailFish
[2:33:03] <+Tribu1982> i think girls earn more in the girl leagues.. then they would in a mens team.. but i think the best girls would be also to be in a lower tier male team

[2:35:35] <+VicLara> if we stop bulling girls on games just cause they are girls, there will be much more of them online

[4:26:28] <Eggzybit> why is xizt's keyboard angled at the opposite way
[4:26:49] <+Skredulla> olof tired
[4:26:55] <+Vexxeyyy> His keyboard is angled like mine somewhat
[4:26:56] <Deadmatey> btw

[4:27:26] <Deadmatey> XD
[4:27:28] <Foxyfluffy> Also I feel old for asking this but what is so meme/funny about this Fortnite game? Is it because kids play it like minecraft?

[4:27:41] <+Skredulla> even if we didn't know, spoiling stuff doesn't make you cool
[4:27:47] <+Vexxeyyy> Just family friendly and a battle royale game

[4:28:49] <Foxyfluffy> Battle royale in general is a gimmick gamemode that's fun with some friends and a few beers but as an actual core gamemode it's trash.

[4:29:56] <+gostrapyaself> ez for the boys can't wait for Grayhound to beat these euro shitters
[4:30:05] <Foxyfluffy> @Deadmatey I believe his name is b& from chat
[4:30:09] <+Vexxeyyy> Grayhound beat SK somehow
[4:30:16] <+hxfzs> @vexxeyyy Thx but I didnt expect that
[4:30:22] <+Vexxeyyy> fr
[4:30:24] <+gostrapyaself> yes now they beat faze
[4:30:34] <+hxfzs> This esl is really wired
[4:31:01] <+Vexxeyyy> NA CS is screwed atm. C9 LOST TO TYLOO... OF ALL TEAMS
[4:31:13] <+gostrapyaself> bntet calling ez
[4:31:14] <Deadmatey> the next actual match is in 6 and a half hours I belive
[4:31:16] <+h0vercat> NRG are NA's hope now
[4:31:18] <+hxfzs> Tyloo won sk and c9
[4:31:19] <Deadmatey> just for the people asking
[4:31:27] <Foxyfluffy> It is a shame that Na'Vi isn't here, Faze is crippled without olof and SK is in ruins. Will kind of take away 10% of the punch of Renegades winning IEM Sydney
[4:31:34] <godbout123> sk also lost to tyloo so maybe tyloo was just playing very well?
[4:31:38] <Foxyfluffy> Which they will
[4:31:48] <+gostrapyaself> 100%
[4:31:51] <Ismking455> Who won?
[4:32:05] <+yaboisimse> both sk and cloud9 have had recent roster changes so that could be a factor
[4:32:10] <+Vexxeyyy> NaVi had Visa Issues, Olof with absence, and SK can't find their game with Stew atm
[4:32:11] <godbout123> wut happene to astralis
[4:32:16] <+blood_crimson> wait does that mean faze has been elminated
[4:32:21] <+hxfzs> Bentnt is 2 good
[4:32:24] <+gostrapyaself> no
[4:32:30] <+h0vercat> astralis cruised throught godbout123
[4:32:35] <JarrayJ> lol Renegades winning iem not with mouz and astralis
[4:32:48] <Dux9> can'
[4:32:54] <mano_peixoto> sk still in?
[4:32:55] <Foxyfluffy> It's funny how with Faze, Cloud9, SK & French scene all going through changes makes lame old slow default Astralis the best team in the world again.
[4:32:57] <+blood_crimson> @gostrapyaself is that for what i said
[4:33:02] <Dux9> can't believe RNG actually beat faze
[4:33:06] <sebbyyy> SK are out
[4:33:33] <+tastyeggss> why is sk very bad at csgo now?
[4:33:37] <mano_peixoto> sure.. thanks
[4:33:38] <JarrayJ> lol defualt they are playing really well and they deserve being the best
[4:33:39] <+blood_crimson> @Dux9 faze is actually crap if you think about it
[4:33:43] <Dux9> @Foxyfluffy What was your excuse the last time Astralis was ranked #1?
[4:34:12] <Foxyfluffy> @Dux9 They hadn't slumped for a couple centuries at that point

[4:34:33] <+Jellyfiish> @tastyeggss because its not their scandinavian lineup ;)
[4:34:38] <Foxyfluffy> @Dux9 Astralis has sucked for months until the other top teams started sucking more
[4:34:45] <+blood_crimson> that is actually a valid point
[4:34:57] <+hxfzs> simple must be best player this year
[4:35:02] <+blood_crimson> is faze not going to the playoffs
[4:35:05] <Foxyfluffy> He is
[4:35:28] <JarrayJ> s1mple is the best play in the world rn
[4:35:28] <godbout123> CHINA # 1 reeeeeeeeeeeee
[4:35:38] <JarrayJ> plaer
[4:35:38] <+h0vercat> faze need to beat grayhound to go forward
[4:35:44] <+blood_crimson> @Foxyfluffy device is better
[4:35:59] <mano_peixoto> What about Taco? Left SK and got kicked off G2?
[4:36:00] <godbout123> @jarrayj nah m8 moe_tv is the best

[4:36:13] <Foxyfluffy> I'm just happy the Brazil scene is dead now. Honestly. Now let's reform french scene and put them in top 3 again with Na'Vi & co and I'm happy.
[4:36:17] <+Vexxeyyy> Nah, steel is OMEGALUL
[4:36:20] <JarrayJ> u right @godbout123
[4:36:34] <godbout123> @mano_peixoto when did taco ever joined g2?
[4:36:46] <godbout123> @mano_peixoto hes in team liquid rn
[4:36:49] <+blood_crimson> @Foxyfluffy what do you mean,the french are already ded
[4:36:50] <JarrayJ> @Foxyfluffy they need to get one or 2 more peeses then they can be the best

[5:24:57] <bobbycritz> They're not very bad at CSGO @tastyeggss, Renegades is the most likely upset to occour out of the many so far. They're still dangerous, but they're not the dominant force that they're supposed to be obviously
[5:25:17] <bobbycritz> LOL FaZe jks
[5:25:21] <+tastyeggss> I think rain is washed so their only good players are niko and guardian
[5:25:31] <+blood_crimson> @bobbycritz lmao "supposed to be"
[5:25:34] <flp_flp7> jks is legend
[5:25:36] <+Vexxeyyy> rain just didnt show up at all
[5:25:47] <+blood_crimson> @tastyeggss did you just call rain washed????
[5:25:54] <porosahora> jkaem > rain lads
[5:25:58] <+blood_crimson> cuz you need to rethink life
[5:26:01] <+tastyeggss> Yes i think rain is washed up like a whale on a beach
[5:26:04] <+Samuukxs> Unlisted was actually the legend last night
[5:26:07] <bobbycritz> @tastyeggss The only one that's actually that level of domination is GuardiaN.

[6:18:06] <Bobmorane666> without olof, faze isn't sustainable
[6:18:07] <ThatFox> The answer is 42.
[6:18:19] <M1ndphr34k> LUL ggtom
[6:18:31] <Bobmorane666> is "your mom" an acceptable answer ?
[6:18:33] <ThatFox> That's not very important.
[6:18:49] <M1ndphr34k> your mom is an acceptible answer to anything imo
[6:19:01] <Bobmorane666> no disrespect tho
[6:19:23] <snekk__> SK is going home LUL

[6:20:02] <tylergoad> If your C9 are you glad ur in the lower bracket instead of upper ? Easier competition in the lower bracket ?
[6:20:08] <ggtom> i put lot of effort in that
[6:20:14] <M1ndphr34k> do you have a blacklist and blacklisted some of the words you wrote :D
[6:20:21] <ggtom> tylergoad im sure that what sk thought

[6:21:21] <c0norek> xizt looks like olof xdd
[6:21:29] <ggtom> i think aussie land put something in food. that why aussie team go through
[6:21:35] <wallahi1> RENEGADE !!
[6:21:49] <M1ndphr34k> you might be onto something ggtom
[6:22:05] <tylergoad> Does that dude on YouTube FaZe Banks or whatever own Faze the CS team?
[6:22:12] <stokeys> massive time difference for some plus jet lag

[6:22:18] <ggtom> u mean the bald faze dude
[6:22:32] <+Spekky> why is every caster saying faze is the best and complaining about how they play? they lost 20% of their star players for god sake

[6:24:07] <ggtom> snekk__ that would just make too much sense
[6:24:09] <M1ndphr34k> split your team over 5 continents so wherever you play someone can step up
[6:24:26] <snekk__> :^)

[6:59:48] <+internetpizza> code academy is also free
[6:59:55] <ggtom> yeh i use python a lot now cuz it has good libraries for machine learning stuff
[7:01:14] <ggtom> coding look hard but it not hard. it just a language that has so many resources online
[7:02:05] <flakkaflash> What do you want to learn? web devolopment ,data science , programming
[7:02:13] <BlayzeRM> ...
[7:02:18] <+water_chestnut> forsenSleeper 💤
[7:02:19] <synarya> good time for ad
[7:02:22] <CatFromSaturn> monkaS
[7:02:25] <BlayzeRM> great time
[7:02:31] <flakkaflash> im stuck in lvl1
[7:02:41] <ggtom> flakkaflash just do programming. the other two are just specializations
[7:02:51] <ggtom> data science = LUL
[7:03:00] <+Bradenm83> !schedule
[7:03:01] <+internetpizza> lol
[7:03:23] <ByronOrpheus> I recommend SoloLearn as well, handy beginner tool for C++ and various languages
[7:03:43] <ggtom> is sololearn a website?
[7:03:46] <+internetpizza> looking forward to watching the rng match(es) in the playoffs, crowd's gonna be so lit
[7:03:49] <ByronOrpheus> app
[7:04:02] <ggtom> i recommend starting with c++ if u truly want to learn programming
[7:04:05] <crypticcsgoofficial> giving away a karambit ruby on my channel, be sure to open a new tab and watch!
[7:04:06] <ilmostrodieurope> CodeAcademy it give you the base needed since 0
[7:04:07] <ggtom> it sets you up very nicely
[7:04:18] <ilmostrodieurope> Java, Phyton, HTML5..
[7:04:30] <ByronOrpheus> bit of a steep learning curve with C++ compared with others
[7:04:31] <stokeys> ^^
[7:04:40] <dacamlp> Who wins
[7:04:50] <+ApotheosisOfScum> RNG
[7:04:53] <ByronOrpheus> you
[7:04:53] <+Bradenm83> renegade
[7:04:54] <ggtom> yeh byron but it encompasses all concepts that most other languages might throw at u
[7:04:59] <dacamlp> Yesssss
[7:05:04] <stokeys> learn 1 language, others are very similar
[7:05:10] <ByronOrpheus> indeed, it's the most transferrable
[7:05:14] <prototypic> guardian is actaully hitting them every time
[7:05:14] <+ApotheosisOfScum> Greyhound made it too
[7:05:22] <+internetpizza> yuuup i started with c++ and learning new languages is ezpz
[7:05:22] <ggtom> easy transition. python very friendly but lots of dynamic casting happening in the background when u transfer
[7:05:35] <+internetpizza> at that point it's just remembering the syntax
[7:05:45] <+internetpizza> er, learning rather
[7:06:23] <prototypic> guardian is havin some shit luck on arch
[7:06:23] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo

[7:07:53] <ggtom> oh wow verynice
[7:08:03] <ggtom> u think it ez for me to become full stack?
[7:08:06] <+internetpizza> we use python and the typical frontend stuff
[7:08:07] <stokeys> im learning to be full stack
[7:08:09] <siri_t4nk> i love this game and my new pc is getting built very soon and ive seen these recent up dates but not sure if i should come back to the game although i love it
[7:08:18] <ggtom> i havent touched web dev in 6 years lel
[7:08:20] <+internetpizza> yeah start with frontend
[7:08:23] <+internetpizza> html/css/js
[7:08:24] <siri_t4nk> seems like its dying, idk :(
[7:08:29] <ggtom> duno if it's worth it tho
[7:08:44] <+internetpizza> once you have that down, spin something up in python like flask and learn how to do ajax calls
[7:08:58] <Pineapple_Drz> is it just me or is GuardiaN like half asleep while he is awping
[7:09:07] <ImGabip> 7 - 1

[7:09:34] <JacobThings> Just learn node.js
[7:09:36] <+internetpizza> oof
[7:09:49] <JacobThings> Node js
[7:09:49] <215330891> what knowledge you learning right now
[7:09:51] <+internetpizza> phd in a tech field is so worth it though
[7:10:09] <prototypic> isnt resident sleeper dota
[7:10:09] <ggtom> internetpizza i duno bro. i see the salaries are high but bro such a time investment
[7:10:31] <ggtom> internetpizza u r banking on graduating in 5 years. my peers have careers now.
[7:10:37] <shadedurza22> OHHHH
[7:10:41] <ggtom> u will make bank if u finish but it's a grind
[7:10:42] <+internetpizza> having that phd will put you on the top of the resume stack at any company
[7:10:45] <psyberscenic> you also don't need the schooling for it
[7:10:54] <ggtom> psyberscenic i agree with that
[7:11:01] <ggtom> it's just evidence
[7:11:01] <JacobThings> @internetpizza not true at all xD
[7:11:15] <+internetpizza> ok fair enough lol
[7:11:16] <ggtom> JacobThings nah he is right for some of the jobs nowadays
[7:11:26] <psyberscenic> your five years would be better spent building something you were interested in--in that field
[7:11:30] <JacobThings> Keyword is some
[7:11:32] <ggtom> lots of 'data science' positions require phd
[7:11:53] <shadedurza22> true @ggtom
[7:11:58] <psyberscenic> sure, but if you just build your own data science <insert whatever badass program here>
[7:12:03] <ggtom> yeh. like i dont see the benefit in software engineering phd
[7:12:10] <psyberscenic> ye
[7:12:13] <ggtom> unless it is design methodology focused one
[7:12:37] <215330891> do you program a lot as data scientist?

[7:13:03] <+internetpizza> i just have my bachelors in software eng, thought about getting my masters but ehhhh
[7:13:05] <ggtom> data science is an iffy field now. lots of different names. lots of celebrity professors going to industry. it's a weird field.
[7:13:11] <TheRickety> !brackets
[7:13:11] <@Moobot> therickety http://www.intelextrememasters.com/season-13/sydney/standings/
[7:13:21] <ggtom> internetpizza dont get masters imo. just get phd or dont do it. just my opinion tho.
[7:13:31] <ggtom> 215330891 most ive used is python
[7:13:36] <psyberscenic> pizza
[7:13:37] <+internetpizza> yeah that's fair
[7:13:48] <+internetpizza> go big or go home
[7:13:53] <ggtom> never had to use java or c++. some of the parallel systems ppl use c++ tho.
[7:13:57] <JacobThings> LUL spending time on masters as fullstack
[7:14:17] <ggtom> internetpizza yeh and mainly it's cuase a masters is just a bunch of course over two years that you legit can learn better and more by yourself
[7:14:25] <+internetpizza> i didn't go to school for full-stack lol, just kinda got into it at my first gig after school
[7:14:47] <sprayzza> where should i apply for university next year?
[7:14:51] <MICI_> where do you live where you can do a phd without a masters?
[7:15:02] <sprayzza> true u need masters for phd
[7:15:06] <psyberscenic> sorry. new to twitch chat (idk if my message posted): @pizza is there anything in particular you're interested in analyzing?
[7:15:07] <+internetpizza> @sprayzza are you dead set on a major?
[7:15:22] <ggtom> internetpizza i get your feeling bro. kind of like 'what would my life have been if i went for phd etc.' i have the same feeling for industry. grass greener on the other side kind of thing
[7:15:22] <+internetpizza> ggtom is the data guy
[7:15:23] <sprayzza> @internetpizza going all the way mate - phd and everything
[7:15:41] <r_hadlee_rh_666> @psyberscenic get out while u still can
[7:15:51] <psyberscenic> haha xD
[7:16:08] <ggtom> sprayzza u dont need master for phd
[7:16:17] <ggtom> well at least for US unis
[7:16:18] <MICI_> you do where i live
[7:16:41] <+internetpizza> find a small tech-focus school, they usually focus on major-specific classes for the entire four years rather than just the last two at a big university
[7:17:28] <sprayzza> @internetpizza ye but im also looking for a schol where they have undergrad and masters at the same place
[7:17:37] <sprayzza> im canadian so i fi apply states i pay international fees

[10:11:58] <FaZe_GuardiaN> fnc wont win lmao not a chance
[10:12:01] <mozos1> @da7 yea man they are playing good as a team
[10:12:05] <mkriv> but it was an exciting match
[10:12:08] <ankitgarg> did they play dust 2 yet?
[10:12:22] <+BarkleyTV> !crosshair
[10:12:22] <da_bears13> astralis win the tour for sure
[10:12:25] <theofficialmiracle> @da_bears13 SK is really in a bad slump at the moment tho
[10:12:25] <humberto322> faze is going to pick dust2
[10:12:36] <humberto322> to outaim greyhound
[10:12:38] <benniejets> i dont think they've played any dust2 yet
[10:12:40] <mozos1> @ankitgarg they wont play dust 2 because tyloo wins inferno and after this is overpass and they win it too
[10:12:42] <da_bears13> @theofficialmiracle i think stewie was a bad decision for the roster
[10:12:48] <ankitgarg> @humberto322 i sure hope someone picks dust off
[10:13:02] <theofficialmiracle> @da_bears13 no, the problem is their ingame calling. They call very bad vs low buy etc
[10:13:04] <mozos1> @FaZe_GuardiaN why fnc wont win ?
[10:13:24] <mkriv> lmao
[10:13:25] <da_bears13> @theofficialmiracle who you think is the best player at the moment in the game?
[10:13:32] <benniejets> nice one rush
[10:13:35] <mkriv> s1imple
[10:13:49] <mkriv> s1mple
[10:13:50] <theofficialmiracle> @da_bears13 it depends on the role and situation. I think there is many good players, not only 1 best player
[10:13:56] <mozos1> @da_bears13 flusha
[10:14:04] <da_bears13> @mkriv + rep bro but i think s1mple never won something with edward and zeus
[10:14:29] <da_bears13> @mozos1 i think s1mple is the most complete player this time
[10:14:34] <mozos1> tyloo wins inferno 16-10
