[1:24:01] <nebeldepre> hey there
[1:24:12] <pcmasteras> BUNE AMK
[1:25:40] <distortia_> why are their keyboards tilted like that?
[1:26:20] <nebeldepre> because they played on lan parties
[1:26:21] <+Scrolls_Incoming> not everyone does that
[1:26:41] <+Scrolls_Incoming> cuz theyre near the monitor
[1:26:44] <+The_Goob_Tube> some people find it more comfortable o their wrists to tilt the board like that
[1:26:56] <nebeldepre> and because they played on lan parties, they didn't had space over the desk
[1:27:25] <+Scrolls_Incoming> they dont have the space not to tilt it when theyre so close
[1:27:41] <+The_Goob_Tube> also confirmed the greater to board tilt the better your aim
[1:28:01] <nebeldepre> but you aim with the mouse
[1:28:08] <+The_Goob_Tube> shhh

[13:41:56] <Tannerchap> yea. i have a few as well.. had an assignment pop up as 49% plagiarized.. well its all osha codes so imagine that..
[13:42:10] <Tannerchap> 10/10 didnt cheat. my prof is just an asshole
[13:42:11] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[13:42:13] <thejabroni> Hahah ain't that some shit
[13:42:30] <thejabroni> esketit
[13:42:43] <Tannerchap> i have no idea who wins this
[13:43:01] <thejabroni> any mg1-mge NA east coast wanna link up some time?
[13:43:11] <+camyo> im gonna key you in it's probably fnatic
[13:43:27] <Tannerchap> prolly theyre nasty..
[13:46:40] <thejabroni> still convinced by that most recent hackusation article on reddit from a couple weeks ago
[13:48:12] <Tannerchap> watching toxic players destroy and talk shit is one of the best parts of gaming
[13:48:16] <izephyrusx> :o i haven't seen that who was it about?
[13:50:24] <thejabroni> there were a bunch but i remember olof made the list. mostly aim assist stuff, hard locking through walls and smokes and looking away very fishy like.
[13:50:43] <+Headshotkillak> i wanna see it so bad
[13:51:53] <izephyrusx> idk
[13:52:36] <izephyrusx> it's hard to say sometimes i've seen my own replays where i happen to place the crosshair on someone through a wall or w/e
[13:52:49] <izephyrusx> and if it happens with me i'm sure that with the amount they play it should happen more
[13:53:19] <Tannerchap> agreed^
[13:55:34] <Tannerchap> i think CS is the only game ive watched hours and hours of but never played
[13:56:53] <ikejay> well heres a tip, they make it look easy
[13:57:24] <Tannerchap> yea.. i wanna buy a pc buy school got me lookin like a broke boii
[13:57:38] <Tannerchap> but*
[13:57:41] <thejabroni> you'd have to watch the vids to see it for yourself its a snap to head position through walls and smokes without any reasonable knowledge
[13:58:10] <ikejay> lol I play on a Mac and im gn1
[13:59:13] <Tannerchap> i have a decent work laptop but the only thing keeping me from playing is the video card.. i get 50ish fps on LoL
[14:00:37] <p1potv> hiko in liquid :(
[14:09:24] <Tannerchap> if i buy and download csgo on my laptop.. and 3 months later get a pc. if i use the same steam account can i download it on that pc too or would i have to buy it again
[14:17:02] <solereavr> @Tannerchap Games bought on steam are account bound, so as long as you have an account you can play games you buy on any computer you log in with.
[14:17:21] <Tannerchap> you da bomb @solereavr thank you
