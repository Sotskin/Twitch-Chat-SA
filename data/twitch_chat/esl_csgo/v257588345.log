[5:05:54] <weirdjack> @problemumad maybe he didnt perform like usual, but only renegades know what the problems are. blaming a player for low kill performance is showing your own ignorance about cs
[5:06:03] <fierycrown> bntet is so underrated

[5:39:24] <Imcronk> @Xtomorph69 but like we all said, he does like to overextend a lot
[5:39:24] <+Teran1246> @Xtomorph69 yeah i guess. especially if your team is not doing well and you can only buy it every 2nd or so round
[5:39:37] <weirdjack> i have to say i've seen many rounds when renegades REALLY did an amazing job at taking sites, also on train

[6:20:13] <+infamous_andrew> is that a grill or a lumber jack
[6:20:13] <+duhvice> nifty was like 43-5 in the rounds they won or something crazy
[6:20:14] <+Teran1246> ska is not a god awper atm. but hes just so lovable.
[6:20:18] <paulnuka1> mousesport wins 3-2
[6:20:21] <faceoverfamily> ska is far away from top 10 awpers in the world wtf

[6:25:20] <ryanbot1234> DBstyle
[6:25:38] <lolihatetwitch> so glad RENEGADES won this
[6:25:49] <+Teran1246> thats true, but sk is having a communication problem, it seems. just like cloud 9. both good teams, but theyre not having enough practice on all the maps as the roster theyre playing as
[6:26:11] <s1Lenceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee> hi can sum1 help me
[6:26:18] <HeLLsiNgg29> sa
[6:26:38] <lolihatetwitch> @Teran1246 man C9 has gone to shit tbh.. FNS was the worst decision in my opinion
[6:26:42] <s1Lenceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee> i hav audio problem my sound in cs is quiet until i click in audio settings and press on output device then it fixes i have to do it every time how to fix
[6:26:48] <+Teran1246> faze showed a lot of weaknesses in the playoffs. definately not as good as astralis this tourney.

[6:28:12] <+JustHer0> @legendofjam well this map went to it because of the crowd not letting jkaem listen to sound
[6:28:13] <+arekilleeen> LUL
[6:28:18] <lolihatetwitch> I absolutely hate how biased the commentators are towards these tourneys dragovich is the main issue he seems upset when things dont go his fav teams way

[6:28:52] <lolihatetwitch> I couldnt care less what his name is I chose the most russian name i could lool
[6:28:59] <lanix2018> A SILVER PRO TEAM
[6:29:02] <trueshiz> commentators should never favor a side so much like these commentators
[6:29:04] <Bygballe1337> it's pretty damn standard that there is a bias towards the home team and the least favored team, which is perfectly fine if you ask me
[6:29:05] <+LegendOfJam> it was really unprofessional
[6:29:31] <lolihatetwitch> home teams I get that but every single one?
[6:29:37] <+LegendOfJam> they did no booth and got the crowd rowdy
[6:29:40] <qut0n> if there are home and away broadcasts, then absolutely. in this case, no
[6:29:44] <+Teran1246> well, theres a reason theyre a little biased to renegades. they have to get the crowd hyped as well . its what they want to hear and makes for a better cast

[8:25:09] <pavel5562> didn't*
[8:25:28] <andolajackson> Kappa
[8:25:31] <Spoidah> thats why I went with the rival 600, hated the feel of 403

[8:35:08] <Jazinna> olof steped down couse of personal reason
[8:35:19] <pavel5562> @Spoidah thats a lot of mice youve tried - ive only had a 15 dollar mouse before the zowie
[8:35:24] <Jazinna> xizt is just a standin
[8:35:31] <andolajackson> arent karri and xizt fnatic bros from 1.6
[8:36:18] <Spoidah> @pavel5562 yeah I had a broken motherboard, I kept blaming it on the mice because they would work for a while and then stop tracking properly

[10:08:43] <ClawTV> live?
[10:08:50] <+lancelot1080> hmm, you are here so i don't think ^^
[10:08:50] <silverboks303> no re run
[10:08:56] <theroadtodrwaldo> Agency had potentially
[10:09:11] <iridiumbobalob> loved nuke
[10:09:11] <Areolaperkington> !next
[10:09:11] <rey327> y but fort got a hype at now

[10:09:11] <@Moobot> IEM Sydney day 5 starts in about: 0s
[10:09:18] <theroadtodrwaldo> They need to work hostages into pro league
[10:09:19] <damager1122233> nuke was good for pubstomps, but in competitive gameplay it was always trash...
[10:09:24] <rey327> free4 all
[10:09:27] <$RickyW> @theroadtodrwaldo lol no
[10:09:40] <iridiumbobalob> that legendary nip final on it
[10:09:47] <+pubertjohnson> nuke has always been trash competitive map
[10:09:57] <theroadtodrwaldo> People are always bitching about wanting something new, easy fix @rickyw
[10:10:23] <theroadtodrwaldo> It’d shake up the strat pool too
[10:10:28] <$RickyW> @theroadtodrwaldo I assure any pros wouldn't like hostages.
[10:10:40] <mybirthname87> is it live ?
[10:10:46] <+makemagik> yes
[10:10:48] <$RickyW> @mybirthname87 No.
[10:10:50] <+pubertjohnson> hostages just couldnt work
[10:10:52] <+lancelot1080> hostages aren't competitive
[10:11:00] <+makemagik> RERUN energy drink is the sponsor for this event
[10:11:08] <silverboks303> maybe they should make some bigger changes to gameplay? add vehicles like scooters, melee weapons etc.
[10:11:10] <+pubertjohnson> i mean you could rework office to be a bomb map if anything
[10:11:37] <+lancelot1080> that's CS not COD or Arma
[10:11:40] <$RickyW> A somewhat cool idea would be to rework bombsites every now and then to make different strats and executes.
[10:11:48] <theroadtodrwaldo> @rickyw welcome to capitalism, it’s about what the audience wants. If they’re clamoring for something new, the worst they could do is try it for a small major and see how it goes
[10:11:52] <$RickyW> So it's not the same over and over.
[10:12:24] <theroadtodrwaldo> Of course pros won’t like it, they get paid tons to run the same four strats, it makes their lives harder
[10:12:27] <+pubertjohnson> Move the site locations would be interesting for sure, something like a golf course moves the hole slightly
[10:12:36] <silverboks303> lancelot1080 but when numbers are dropping maybe its time to make crazy changes :D
[10:12:37] <+lancelot1080> ricky, it's not easy, you must balance every strong place
[10:12:55] <$RickyW> @lancelot1080 Just an idea.
[10:12:59] <Mutdog> !schedule
[10:12:59] <@Moobot> @Mutdog http://www.intelextrememasters.com/season-13/sydney/matches/#?matchday=1
[10:13:05] <+lancelot1080> That's CS, you want changes? change game
[10:13:29] <silverboks303> lancelot1080 gotta adapt to what people want
[10:13:39] <$RickyW> But we all know Valve won't do anything so why bother. :P
[10:13:43] <theroadtodrwaldo> Adapt or die
[10:13:47] <+lancelot1080> Ricky, not a bad idea, but complicated ;)
[10:13:52] <+pubertjohnson> the pros will always adapt and find the meta
[10:13:58] <$RickyW> @lancelot1080 For sure.
[10:14:24] <signup111> Cx
[10:14:34] <+lancelot1080> 15 years the game is the same, come on guys that's CS that repetitive but competitive
[10:14:48] <theroadtodrwaldo> I’m not saying Office or Agency necessarily, hostage maps of yesteryear too, like Italy
[10:14:56] <damager1122233> as i said, this is a very dead game... the only thing keeping it alive are the skins...
[10:15:02] <$RickyW> Time to go play Fortnite. :)
[10:15:10] <silverboks303> its not dead
[10:15:12] <damager1122233> and one thing that helps killing it is the RNG on the weapons
[10:15:15] <+pubertjohnson> @lancelot1080 you are 100% correct, but it just feels a bit stale
[10:15:27] <niqel_> who got map 1?
[10:15:31] <iridiumbobalob> heard that before lol
[10:15:37] <+makemagik> K A R R Y G O D
[10:15:47] <GODMIKEPMP> Kids been crying very dead game since 1999.
[10:15:50] <luiscff_157> LUL
[10:15:57] <+lancelot1080> i began on the 1.3 and i still here ^^
[10:15:58] <theroadtodrwaldo> IMO if you’re not changing anything and getting viewership like this then it’s far from dead
[10:15:58] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[10:16:04] <GODMIKEPMP> Still watching it, and still love playing it.
[10:16:13] <damager1122233> well, not really... i've been playin' it since 2000
[10:16:25] <damager1122233> but really, it was never this frustrating to have fun on it
[10:16:34] <iridiumbobalob> de_dust constantly
[10:16:39] <+makemagik> @damager1122233 i play a lot (was 1.6 player) and I don't care about skins, ihmo f$)$* skins, it ruins the game.
[10:16:43] <silverboks303> battle royale is the latest craze
[10:16:46] <GODMIKEPMP> This is the greatest competitive FPS and there is nothing in the market to compete with it.
[10:16:52] <GODMIKEPMP> I love the niche its thriving in.
[10:17:13] <+makemagik> they just need to sells skins in order to get money to pay for their sh&&ty 64tick MM and public servers
[10:17:21] <theroadtodrwaldo> R6 is the next closest and it’s not even close
[10:17:25] <iridiumbobalob> didnt like source but csgo brought it back
[10:17:28] <encsnoob> is this rerun of final??
[10:17:36] <silverboks303> rerun
[10:17:42] <+message_delet3d> this is a rerun
[10:17:50] <damager1122233> i didnt like source either, then i loved cs:go
[10:18:03] <encsnoob> i know but is it a rerun on the final?
[10:18:11] <+pubertjohnson> no
[10:18:11] <damager1122233> but they killed the fun with the rng s
[10:18:12] <Carapodre> Fortnite will die when the next "amazing new battle royale" cames out LUL
[10:18:13] <+sniggl> quaterfinals!
[10:18:21] <+message_delet3d> leading to semi final
[10:18:23] <damager1122233> RNGs
[10:18:26] <encsnoob> okey 😀😀
[10:18:45] <GODMIKEPMP> My whole point is for this game to be " Dead" something needs to take it
[10:18:45] <+lancelot1080> i feels GO like the 1.5 and i like it so much
[10:18:50] <silverboks303> wtf jw
[10:18:55] <+Cdogg84> where is olof
[10:19:01] <silverboks303> i dont have sound. what was that
[10:19:04] <GODMIKEPMP> its' place cause us fans of competitive first person shooters aren't going away
[10:19:06] <damager1122233> when you spray a weapon that you mastererd, and the other dude casually 1taps you while running\
[10:19:08] <iridiumbobalob> back in wonid's
[10:19:19] <damager1122233> it's a magic feeling
[10:19:24] <GODMIKEPMP> and we sure aren't going to be watching any boring AF FPS like PUBg in competition.
[10:19:35] <encsnoob> have faze kicked olof?
[10:19:35] <waylaand> dat flying awp head shot feeling
[10:19:35] <therealmarkoni> @Cdogg84 he is taking a break he took a break 1 month ago where were you lol
[10:19:43] <+Cdogg84> oh
[10:19:56] <+Cdogg84> not a die hard faze fan
[10:19:58] <GODMIKEPMP> Does Olof need to take a break to heal his arm?
[10:20:08] <encsnoob> faze is better without olof
[10:20:11] <+Cdogg84> c9 is my favorite
[10:20:13] <therealmarkoni> idk he said its personal issue
[10:20:15] <GODMIKEPMP> Like a precautionary approach.
[10:20:17] <damager1122233> actually he took a rehab trip
[10:20:17] <silverboks303> he has family problems or something
[10:20:20] <frodolicius> c9 da best
[10:20:23] <therealmarkoni> @encsnoob noope
[10:20:32] <+lancelot1080> Cs is one of the most popular game for competition, always on top 3 since 10 years, not bad for a dead game ^^
[10:20:32] <frodolicius> but everyone should know about olof xD
[10:20:43] <encsnoob> remember how he was holding train B in the superfinal and then they lost after that
[10:20:47] <therealmarkoni> they are screwed without,its gonna be hard for them to win against astralis

[10:20:57] <+ruud_o> olof got hemoroids and cant sit in chair hurts his behind
[10:21:05] <therealmarkoni> i really hope that they win this tournament
[10:21:08] <waylaand> is niko even human I mean wtf
[10:21:09] <GODMIKEPMP> Highly competitive first person shooters are never going to have as many players as games like WoW in prime.
[10:21:14] <theroadtodrwaldo> Astralis is in top form
[10:21:15] <encsnoob> robban should make a comeback

[10:21:55] <GODMIKEPMP> The competition is still going to be stellar none the less.
[10:21:55] <@Moobot> IEM Sydney day 5 starts in about: 0s
[10:22:17] <therealmarkoni> @Tardedaresomodsre it will be hard to win this tournament without olof.
[10:22:20] <+lancelot1080> i didn't spoke about players numbers, but about viewers
[10:22:36] <encsnoob> this is a rerun not live
[10:22:37] <therealmarkoni> its rerun.
[10:22:45] <Carapodre> why are u comparing things so diferent? WoW and CS kkkkk
[10:22:56] <Tardedaresomodsre> no, they just need niko rain to show up, not choke in finals
[10:23:02] <+ruud_o> the stream is live how can it be a rerun
[10:23:05] <+makemagik> RERUN Energy iis the sponsor for this event. This is live.
[10:23:07] <GODMIKEPMP> Okay what would you like to compare it too
[10:23:08] <damager1122233> bro, you talking wow in his prime, im telling you to research League of legends... they got ~100 million viewers...
[10:23:26] <Carapodre> to another FPS game, fair
[10:23:37] <GODMIKEPMP> There is none to compare it too
[10:23:39] <encsnoob> I hate lol
[10:23:47] <silverboks303> 99 million bots tho Kappa
[10:23:47] <Carapodre> exact lol
[10:23:54] <GODMIKEPMP> My whole point is no FPS is in its league.
[10:24:00] <+lancelot1080> compare FPS and MOBA, why not a point and click?
[10:24:03] <Carapodre> every one plays this "dead" game LUL
[10:24:07] <damager1122233> actually, 99 million chinese boyz :)
[10:24:07] <encsnoob> tbh I loved CS 1.6 cpl that was fun to watch in HLTV
[10:24:10] <+makemagik> N i K O
[10:24:16] <+sniggl> get niko and niffty in one team, and they rule all alone
[10:24:24] <encsnoob> CS 1.5
[10:24:26] <theroadtodrwaldo> Like I said R6 is closest and it’s not even close
[10:24:32] <GODMIKEPMP> LoL had a cash influx but has inferior strategy to this game. Dota 2 is greater but Valve puts money into that.
[10:24:36] <Scorchl> ffs
[10:24:40] <iridiumbobalob> before steam was best so yeah like 1.5
[10:24:41] <+makemagik> FaZe coach be like : I love you guys, do what you want.

[10:48:58] <theroadtodrwaldo> @kasparovwannabe it really depends on how many other games they sponsor, CSGO Specific teams are more likely to give more of the winnings to the players
[10:49:17] <JeraldLIVE> Faze and Liquid
[10:49:27] <kasparovwannabe> True. Too variable to make general statements
[10:51:00] <Rated6> wanna see faze vs tyloooooooooo

[11:58:01] <opkampitak> ty
[11:58:06] <smith_jjj> np
[11:58:06] <voxiccsgo> If faze win this tournament then you all have to give me $100

[12:00:28] <ihavenousername> Who one
[12:00:36] <+G335U5> so like 40 minutes?
[12:00:40] <ihavenousername> The match I know it was 1-1
[12:00:44] <PentagonSenpai> again live in 4h tyloo vs faze
[12:00:50] <+G335U5> mouz
[12:00:53] <dan7775047> 12.30 i think
[12:01:02] <+G335U5> ty pent
[12:01:04] <smith_jjj> next map inferno ;) fo Renegades
[12:01:11] <ihavenousername> Renegades-should have one
[12:01:14] <voxiccsgo> faze are easily gonna win against no names tyloo
[12:01:22] <dan7775047> spoilers MOUZ won
[12:01:30] <smith_jjj> 2:1 for mousesports ;)
[12:01:34] <PentagonSenpai> i predict 2-1 for faze
[12:01:44] <voxiccsgo> renegades won
[12:01:46] <ihavenousername> Renegades won inferno
[12:01:47] <PentagonSenpai> and 2-0 for astralis
[12:01:50] <smith_jjj> 23/25 and 19:15
[12:01:57] <PentagonSenpai> so final would be like faze vs astralis
[12:01:58] <voxiccsgo> faze will beat astralis
[12:02:22] <PentagonSenpai> yeah it is possible but still a tough match
[12:02:40] <voxiccsgo> the way they played against fnatic was so dominant, i think it will be a good game to watch
[12:03:08] <PentagonSenpai> ye, i'm just sleepy af and i got to get up in 4h again to watch the next match

[14:06:36] <voxiccsgo> ban inferno its a boring map
[14:06:58] <penguino007> pros dont ban a map they are good on because its boring rofl
[14:06:58] <PopmanOO7> inferno boring are you mad
[14:07:03] <TE_Saffe> They just need more experience, going 7-0 down on map one was just such inexperience and also lack of controling emotions which was a shame
[14:07:08] <voxiccsgo> its so overplayed
[14:07:19] <+00TheWongWay> What about mirage tho
[14:07:27] <PopmanOO7> still a great map in bo3
[14:07:37] <voxiccsgo> thats alright since only the best teams can master it
