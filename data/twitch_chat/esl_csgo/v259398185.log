[14:13:57] <fartingtitm4n> This isn't star trek dude. You can't just magically go back in time to 'replay' a match. Quit trolling
[14:14:10] <+SnaxGD> lol look at the name of the boradcast "RERUN: G2 vs. mousesports [Dust2] Map 1 - Group B LB Deciders Match - IEM Sydney 2018"
[14:14:39] <ufuk___> Rerun SwiftRage
[14:14:41] <fartingtitm4n> A lot of the time titles are fake news. Do you just believe everything you read without evidence?
[14:15:06] <+SnaxGD> the evidence is that you need mental help

[23:08:28] <+kidfisher99> how do you get loot?
[23:08:37] <xValkii> czgo
[23:08:47] <+kidfisher99> and how do you know if a stream is providing loot/drops?
[23:09:47] <paav098> this is a replay so u cant get any
[23:10:30] <+kidfisher99> okay thank you. how do you know if a stream is providing them (for any game)
[23:11:00] <paav098> only majors pprovide loot
[23:11:21] <paav098> so if it is a major u know u can get loot
[23:11:37] <+kidfisher99> majors? you mean like the later tournament rounds
[23:12:12] <OllySza> i think he means the biggest tournaments
[23:12:18] <TheBlubbi> Major like valve sponsored tournament, you can buy stickers in game etc.
[23:12:41] <TheBlubbi> next one is in london in september i think
[23:12:41] <OllySza> @TheBlubbi and there is the pick em challenge
[23:12:44] <+kidfisher99> okay, so private streamers, such as you tubers cant have it?
[23:12:52] <+BloomieAU> A stream doesn't provide the loot.
[23:12:53] <+ezcade99> KappaHD
[23:13:11] <+BloomieAU> @kidfisher99 maybe go google search this... before we all facepalm.
[23:13:11] <OllySza> You have to watch the match in-game
[23:13:31] <TheBlubbi> if youtuber has enough money its possible, but no one except pewdiepie can rent a arena and co
[23:13:44] <+BloomieAU> The stream (***) doesn't provide anything. you have to spectate via ingame spectator feature.
[23:13:58] <OllySza> @BloomieAU Correct
[23:14:01] <+BloomieAU> It's only during Pick-Em majors.
[23:14:31] <TheBlubbi> you can link twitch and its fine
[23:14:44] <OllySza> And it's also more fun to watch it in-game because you can see their chat
[23:14:57] <OllySza> i remember watching cloud 9 vs g2
[23:15:06] <+kidfisher99> i know it works ingame, but i had found a page on twitch talking about how to earn drops
[23:15:20] <+kidfisher99> i dont know if i can put a link in here or not
[23:15:24] <+BloomieAU> Sync your Steam platform with Twitch profile.
[23:15:33] <+kidfisher99> i did
[23:15:39] <TheBlubbi> i remeber getting 6 fcking mirage drops, and not one good one....great major
[23:15:41] <+BloomieAU> Good, so wait for a Major now.
[23:15:45] <+MusclePantsTV> there is no drops now right?!
[23:15:55] <TheBlubbi> no drops
[23:16:00] <OllySza> no
[23:16:05] <+BloomieAU> the IQ of this chat... hurts my head.
[23:16:06] <+xXGmunGamingXx> wait what?
[23:16:16] <+xXGmunGamingXx> why
[23:16:19] <kedd152> is this live
[23:16:23] <+kidfisher99> can rocket league streams have them? in the majors
[23:16:30] <+BloomieAU> yeah its live, thats why the title says "RERUN"
[23:16:31] <OllySza> BloomieAU: It's only during Pick-Em majors.
[23:16:33] <+kidfisher99> if that is a thing
[23:17:23] <kedd152> ?
[23:17:28] <OllySza> @kidfisher99 you're watching CS:GO not rocket league

[1 day, 22:51:33] <kedipari> 1440 165
[1 day, 22:51:37] <franklos> 165
[1 day, 22:51:50] <MotiMaker> what was your prev monitor_
[1 day, 22:51:54] <BACATCHER> thank you
[1 day, 22:52:01] <MotiMaker> if it was 144hz buy 240hz
[1 day, 22:52:12] <MotiMaker> if 60hz go for the 165hz
[1 day, 22:52:18] <BACATCHER> um im still using it but im about to order, its a really shitty one its just 1080p 60hz
[1 day, 22:52:46] <MotiMaker> then buy the 165hz, can your computer run 1440p?
[1 day, 22:53:50] <BACATCHER> yes it can, on most games anyway i already know
[1 day, 22:54:28] <MotiMaker> ya then just go for the 165 1440p if you used 60 hz you cant see the difference between 165 and 240
[1 day, 22:54:39] <dyBBuKPT> Is better 27 180hz or 24,5 240hz ?
[1 day, 22:54:40] <MotiMaker> hz
