[1 day, 0:25:58] <Ecp7> shroud was the problem confirmed
[1 day, 0:26:10] <tono_blm7> kick rush or fns and put shroud
[1 day, 0:26:19] <+meanleanmememachinexd> Shroud retired tho
[1 day, 0:26:20] <+Gretzky996> i hate to say that but, that win against faze was just a fluke im all honesty
[1 day, 0:26:21] <Ecp7> shroud in 2k18 LUK
[1 day, 0:26:34] <tono_blm7> @gretzky996 i think the same
[1 day, 0:26:43] <+meanleanmememachinexd> Honestly i agree
[1 day, 0:26:45] <Ecp7> well we all can win againsr faze in a final if the crowd screams where everyone is
[1 day, 0:26:58] <+meanleanmememachinexd> Lol true
[1 day, 0:27:08] <+Gretzky996> It was a great win for NA CS but i dont think it will happen again for a LONG time
[1 day, 0:27:32] <+meanleanmememachinexd> f there was anyone in the smoke

[1 day, 0:29:30] <+Gretzky996> the only NA hopeful teams we have is C9 which was a complete fluke for them, Liquid, which isnt even an NA team and Renegades, which LUL
[1 day, 0:31:38] <+Gretzky996> IEM sydney <3
[1 day, 0:31:58] <+ThunderCloudNathan> @gretzky996 you realize C9 beat Faze 2-0 very recently yes?
[1 day, 0:32:09] <+Kootss> can't wait for sydney
[1 day, 0:32:21] <+Gretzky996> @ThunderCloudNathan You do realize faze was without one of the best players and was playing with xzist
[1 day, 0:32:46] <+Kootss> not best but most important
[1 day, 0:33:03] <+Gretzky996> Nahhhh olof is for sure one of the best
[1 day, 0:33:06] <+ThunderCloudNathan> yes and C9 had fns. xizt isnt that bad and there are bigger fraggers on faze than olaf
[1 day, 0:33:39] <+Gretzky996> I disagree but you are more than welcome to have your own opinion @ThunderCloudNathan
[1 day, 0:33:43] <+Kootss> olof was arguably the worst player on faze except karrigan
[1 day, 0:34:15] <+Kootss> but he did do alot of what kio did for faze
[1 day, 0:34:22] <+Gretzky996> He hasnt been as dominate and i personally think thats down to leadership role on faze imo
[1 day, 0:34:59] <+Kootss> yea I think it's also olof being willing to take a step back and play more for the team
[1 day, 0:35:02] <+ThunderCloudNathan> @gretzky996 All I'm saying if they both went through a 1 person roster change, neither losing high fragging players and faze still lost 2-0
[1 day, 0:35:39] <+ThunderCloudNathan> is*
[1 day, 0:35:48] <+Gretzky996> @ThunderCloudNathan Theres a HUGE difference when you are losing olof, compared to the loss of stewie
[1 day, 0:36:28] <+ThunderCloudNathan> Olof and stewie both dont really have big impacts on their team. i love olof, and hes good, but not better than most of faze.
[1 day, 0:36:47] <+Gretzky996> You are just being crazy now thunde
[1 day, 0:36:59] <+ThunderCloudNathan> and I'd say fns is worse than xizt.
[1 day, 0:37:45] <+Gretzky996> if karriigan stepped down as IGL olof would turn up and dominate once again.
[1 day, 0:38:00] <+ThunderCloudNathan> Now that's crazy.
[1 day, 0:38:13] <+Gretzky996> Olof doesn't mesh in well with what Faze wants to run imo. Plus honestly i dont think karrigan is that great of an IGL
[1 day, 0:39:02] <+Gretzky996> If you just simply look at Fnatic it just shows how much of an IGL makes on a team
