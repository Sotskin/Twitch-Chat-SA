[4:28:23] <+Lamaredia> Friendship over with Olofmeister, Xizt new best friend
[4:28:25] <Bouncy_GG> @keno_h At least the R6 devs can actually balance their game. Remember how Valve added the R8 and made it so it did the same damage as an AWP or how Valve made the AUG stupidly OP? Anytime something OP is added in R6 the devs quickly deal with it.
[4:28:25] <+Koisong> nobody stream R6
[4:28:37] <sociopath1300> astralis win this
[4:28:39] <+Koisong> thats right
[4:28:40] <kickme01> @Keno_h a mythological creature
[4:28:53] <+Julieh23> @Bouncy_GG Like the CS:GO devs who also quickly dealt with the R8 and AUG being OP
[4:28:55] <+Selaphane> the R8 was literally nerfed in a day dude
[4:29:00] <Roger_Li_csgo> Glav sucks
[4:29:07] <scippa> thats why those guys are in cs go streams, because people respond^^
[4:29:08] <+exgonne> @Keno_h the 5th element
[4:29:14] <+Bassman6775> @Bouncy_GG They also make season pass crap op for the first two weeks then balance them to get people to buy the season pass
[4:29:17] <sociopath1300> niko turn off aim hack?
[4:29:21] <Keno_h> @kickme01 what are they made off?
[4:29:24] <kniv_eag1e> Valve only makes guns op to see if the players will go away from the meta
[4:29:37] <Bouncy_GG> @koisong If nobody streams R6 then how iw it killing CSGO?

[10:07:34] <albehar99> its 3-0
[10:07:42] <shieldzs> i still remember when everyone called faze trash when they first started and now theyre #1
[10:07:46] <fuzzy12345678901> olof was good 2 years back
[10:07:54] <+Nattyboro> olof WAS good. not so much anymore
[10:07:59] <gg_ian> olof was good in cs 1.6
[10:08:02] <B3ntDownSpoon> FailFish
[10:08:05] <fuzzy12345678901> just like get right was 4 years back....
[10:08:09] <lickmypetals> Olof lost his mojo, maybe he'll be good again
[10:08:20] <finloid786> Guardian one of the best awpers
[10:08:21] <fuzzy12345678901> all r good players...but past their prime
[10:08:30] <gg_ian> guardian was a better awper in 1.6
[10:08:32] <B3ntDownSpoon> the wall art on overpass is literally because of him
[10:08:44] <shieldzs> 1.6 was a way different game
[10:08:52] <KnifeAce> all of faze players are past their prime. When i see them flick, their reaction is so slow its horrible for me to watch
[10:08:54] <finloid786> but kennys is better awper than guardian
[10:09:00] <fuzzy12345678901> guardian is the best aggressive awper in the game
[10:09:05] <+dome8007> guardian ist the best awp player
[10:09:12] <B3ntDownSpoon> NiKo past prime?????? what?
[10:09:12] <fuzzy12345678901> kenny was good
[10:09:17] <finloid786> kennys is better
[10:09:18] <shieldzs> past their prime? LMAO have you not seen gaurdian and rain? and nik9
[10:09:22] <+caloroin2> jdm best awper
[10:09:28] <finloid786> kennys
[10:09:29] <+dome8007> @finloid786 kenny was good
[10:09:30] <gg_ian> astralis was better in overpass on 1.6
[10:09:31] <shieldzs> xist coming in and being on top in the first map?
[10:09:32] <fuzzy12345678901> m talking about olof
[10:09:35] <c0norek> simple is the best
[10:09:42] <+makemagik> anybody want to laugh at the big mics with me? it looks so funnny
[10:09:42] <shieldzs> kenny is dead
[10:09:45] <B3ntDownSpoon> Kennys started being shit when the awp nerf happened
[10:09:49] <gg_ian> astralis would have won that map in 1.6 overpass
[10:09:56] <twitch_in_2018_lul> the toggle is just to stronk
[10:10:03] <tigre33> yeah Simple best in the world maybe
[10:10:04] <shieldzs> well this isnt 1.6 boy
[10:10:13] <+tracery_> faze won
[10:10:23] <+makemagik> australian mics = big mics = big d :D
[10:10:24] <fuzzy12345678901> m looking forward to NIP nxt match...they have players with best potential
[10:10:29] <B3ntDownSpoon> gg_ian do you actually know ANYTHING about 1.6?

[10:22:05] <B3ntDownSpoon> can we lob this kid
[10:22:05] <gg_ian> guardian gained a lot of weight this year, which is why his flick is slower than usual
[10:22:05] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs

[19:21:37] <im_from_israel> People still watching cs in 2018 LUL
[19:21:44] <+rabbbitsfoot> how do they not hear the announcers
[19:21:53] <1ndoors> Tom cruise?
[19:21:55] <+PhoenixArchangel7> they have 2 headphones
[19:21:58] <+AbbeVe> theyre deaf
[19:22:08] <+rabbbitsfoot> LUL
[19:22:14] <AstroJay23> lol why does a grand final only have 2k viewers? csgo is dead since skins trade update.
[19:22:19] <1ndoors> They have headphones on under there headsets
[19:22:24] <+PhoenixArchangel7> they have plugged eardrops for audio and teamspeak , and the big headphones are for noise canceling
[19:22:50] <+AbbeVe> no those are just for show
[19:22:55] <+PhoenixArchangel7> they have 2 earphones 1 is plugged in they`re ear for sound and team comunication , the big headphones they wear are noise canceling specially made so they cant hear anything outside it
[19:23:01] <1ndoors> @astrojay23 rerun smarty
[19:23:13] <+AbbeVe> they just have to promise not to listen
[19:23:16] <AstroJay23> what if players hold down use mic to hear casters?
[19:23:58] <AstroJay23> mics pick up crowd noise how much more casters
[19:24:02] <+rabbbitsfoot> i think that would be too distracting
[19:24:06] <+PhoenixArchangel7> they cant hear dude i have those earphones too
[19:24:20] <+PhoenixArchangel7> if someone even SCREAMS in your ear with those headphones on u wont hear htem
[19:24:36] <+PhoenixArchangel7> its like a void sound very good for hearing footsteps
[19:24:42] <+PhoenixArchangel7> but they are Expensive as hell!!
[19:25:03] <Corvusmellori> what headphones
[19:25:06] <+rabbbitsfoot> i wanna go to one of these
[19:25:09] <AstroJay23> I mean crowd noise is heard through mic which relays to players. so caster noisd probably too
[19:25:17] <+AbbeVe> beats by dre
[19:25:24] <+PhoenixArchangel7> crowd is heard threw the mic of casters

[22:02:43] <+OrbieHD> astralis win 3-0
[22:02:46] <afromato> @mancika19 olof was good as hell when he was in fnatic he dominated everywhere but now he is weak he changed style but xizt style is better my opinion
[22:02:52] <4ng240> @sephiroth1150 they won 3-0
[22:03:03] <+knightdenis> Faze is nr 1 on this world THE REAL NR 1
[22:03:15] <+knightdenis> Niko/guardian are Nr1
[22:03:26] <GODMIKEPMP> @afromato you think Olof changed his style when dominating on Fnatic so he could be worse? Dude had an arm injury that changed his career
[22:03:27] <sudh33r> no
[22:03:41] <+knightdenis> when you have the best riffler and the best awp you are nr.1
[22:03:48] <GODMIKEPMP> ^

[1 day, 3:52:12] <+amnesia_111> i just got of my 3 day 86 hour shift and just got a chance to watch this
[1 day, 3:52:24] <theofficialmiracle> astralis did some major mistakes in the finals, thats why they lost. they had the series easy tbh
[1 day, 3:52:37] <warluck89> Who else loves this map?
[1 day, 3:52:47] <WhLehack> None
[1 day, 3:52:48] <Avarice241> Faze made mistakes also
[1 day, 3:53:29] <theofficialmiracle> ofc but when you are T on cache vs cz + armor and its 15-14 to your team, you dont simply just rush out mid giving away free ak after 10 seconds
[1 day, 3:53:43] <theofficialmiracle> play slow and look for mistakes, easy win, but nah, panic call
[1 day, 3:54:00] <Avarice241> Faze's pacing though the whole final was awful
[1 day, 3:54:21] <Avarice241> gave so much space to Astralis
