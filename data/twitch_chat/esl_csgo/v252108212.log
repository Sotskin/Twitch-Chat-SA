[1 day, 11:31:07] <ifoundmycar> Oooohhh
[1 day, 11:31:07] <+Rory_El_Waster> @ifoundmycar because of tomorrow dummt
[1 day, 11:31:22] <ifoundmycar> :) What's tmrw?
[1 day, 11:31:30] <PurpIeYoshi> i mean C9 gon take that W but still
[1 day, 11:31:30] <+Rory_El_Waster> Fka slow mode
[1 day, 11:32:14] <+Rory_El_Waster> @purpieyoshi Team Liquid thought that too
[1 day, 11:32:25] <ifoundmycar> :P
[1 day, 11:32:55] <PurpIeYoshi> team liquid whiff tho saw the match
[1 day, 11:33:04] <+Rory_El_Waster> It will be interesting to see if C9 ban overpass
[1 day, 11:33:21] <ifoundmycar> Is there a big comp tmrw?
[1 day, 11:33:32] <PurpIeYoshi> they should theyre pretty good in other maps
[1 day, 11:33:52] <PurpIeYoshi> dreamhack @ifoundmycar
[1 day, 11:34:10] <+Rory_El_Waster> @purpieyoshi yep, and it‚Äôs gambits only good map. But c9 are afraid a team will pick nuke
[1 day, 11:34:10] <ifoundmycar> What's dreamhack, sorry I noob
[1 day, 11:34:23] <+Rory_El_Waster> @ifoundmycar you‚Äôll find out it 5 hours
[1 day, 11:34:37] <ifoundmycar> 5 hrs?
[1 day, 11:34:46] <PurpIeYoshi> i mean almost nobody pick nuke nowadays
[1 day, 11:34:47] <+Rory_El_Waster> 5
[1 day, 11:35:01] <PurpIeYoshi> its mostly mirage cache cbble
[1 day, 11:35:18] <PurpIeYoshi> maybe train leftover
[1 day, 11:35:55] <+Rory_El_Waster> @purpieyoshi C9 always ban Nuke, and Gambit always pick overpass, so if you‚Äôre c9, you could take a big risk and ban overpass instead, because then gambit has to pick something like Train
[1 day, 11:36:47] <blowfish_ouo> will it drop the case?
[1 day, 11:36:50] <+Rory_El_Waster> But realistically I think c9 will play overpass, pick mirage, and train/cache will be left over
[1 day, 11:37:10] <PurpIeYoshi> if they win overpass its over
[1 day, 11:37:38] <blowfish_ouo> guys
[1 day, 11:37:42] <PurpIeYoshi> even if they lose mirage and train is easy for them but that would mostly be the matchup
[1 day, 11:37:46] <+Rory_El_Waster> Yup, and C9 has looked good on overpass against Faze so maybe they‚Äôll just say ‚Äúfuck it, we‚Äôll play gambit on it‚Äù
[1 day, 11:38:00] <PurpIeYoshi> yeah üòÇ they got confidence
[1 day, 11:38:05] <blowfish_ouo> will it drop the case?
[1 day, 11:38:19] <+Rory_El_Waster> @blowfish_ouo shut your mouth
[1 day, 11:38:23] <PurpIeYoshi> @blowfish_ouo tf?
[1 day, 11:39:45] <blowfish_ouo> You are so rude
[1 day, 11:39:58] <ifoundmycar> How much has c9's roster changed?
[1 day, 11:40:02] <PurpIeYoshi> if C9 loses im over it, but tbh, i think they got it easy
[1 day, 11:40:12] <PurpIeYoshi> stew replace by fns thats bout it
