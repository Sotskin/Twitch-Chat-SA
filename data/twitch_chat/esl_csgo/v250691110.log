[2:24:40] <deathslave1207> whatas even is that emote
[2:24:44] <+sleepyosh> yeah commentary is definitely weak. Can't expect too much in a group stage
[2:25:36] <deathslave1207> they are giving no motiuvation good enough to make me think that liquid is going to win
[2:25:57] <deathslave1207> or that anyone is going to win
[2:26:15] <+RosettaStoned66> ye, no one wins this match
[2:26:28] <+sleepyosh> yeah I'm not sure what you mean death slave lol

[6:00:39] <cryllic1> damn re learning all those spray patterns
[6:01:04] <TheDauntlessKunt> The 2 year pleb hype is just over
[6:01:11] <cryllic1> got to say m4 is harder for me than ak
[6:01:27] <Dylan_204> It’s been over thrown by Battle Royale games
[6:01:50] <Dylan_204> M4 is good for unarmored
[6:02:14] <TheDauntlessKunt> Which will bleed out in some years, and then the hype crowd will move to another game
[6:02:24] <TheDauntlessKunt> That's just how it works
[6:02:32] <cryllic1> #Dylan_204 now isnt that true
[6:03:32] <cryllic1> probably maybe Dungeons and Dragons
[6:04:33] <Pivel_> youre braindead if you think csgo fans moved to "competitive battyle royal games" lmfao

[14:12:50] <+danshal> In the casters
[14:20:45] <acefighter92> the nips
[14:30:03] <+CaBlazze> is it a problem that i love this game ( i m new ) but i hate the Ak47?
[14:30:31] <+Agentwolf88> yes XD
[14:30:33] <acefighter92> main t weapon
[14:30:49] <+CaBlazze> i prefer the m4 but 1 bullet head is too op
[14:32:42] <TAG_ME_IF_BIBLETHUMP> i havent met a single person who wouldnt drop the m4 for the ak
[14:33:10] <+CaBlazze> the reason is i cant play with Ak4 xD hard to control . And i prefer the m4 sound
[14:33:25] <acefighter92> i feel like the m4 is more accurate
[14:33:35] <acefighter92> i do occasionaly
[14:33:39] <+CaBlazze> yes for beginners like me it helps
[14:33:39] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[14:33:50] <dacamlp> don't spray then
[14:34:06] <+Agentwolf88> @acefighter92 thats right
[14:34:11] <dacamlp> learn the spray patern
[14:34:12] <acefighter92> well you cant say dont spray lol
[14:34:34] <+CaBlazze> yes i need to learn at least for 10 bulles lul
[14:34:40] <acefighter92> just aim at the ground if youre gunna spray ;p;
[14:35:35] <TAG_ME_IF_BIBLETHUMP> i think the ak outperforms the m4, especially on long rage
[14:36:03] <+CaBlazze> one long rage u shot 1 bullet only and repeat? or u shoot like 2-3?
[14:36:06] <acefighter92> easily
[14:36:14] <+CaBlazze> at*
[14:36:15] <TAG_ME_IF_BIBLETHUMP> it depends on situation
[14:36:20] <acefighter92> well no i asgree
[14:36:31] <acefighter92> out preforms definitley
[14:36:32] <Antz12354> i usually burst 2-3
[14:37:18] <+CaBlazze> ty boyz
[14:37:35] <+Wingfan> old nuke? wtf
[14:37:46] <acefighter92> long range ill tap
[14:37:58] <TAG_ME_IF_BIBLETHUMP> i think i am tapping more. i feel it more accurate if i feel sure that i wont get hs'd. but like, when peek shooting, i mostly burst
[14:38:01] <acefighter92> medium burst
[14:38:04] <+Wingfan> lawl saw now it was rerun XD
[14:38:37] <Antz12354> when im close or medium range i usually spray
[14:38:59] <acefighter92> depends on the situatoin
[14:39:45] <acefighter92> i prefer both assault rifles over awp
