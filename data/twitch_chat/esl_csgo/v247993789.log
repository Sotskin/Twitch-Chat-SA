[12:01:08] <+epicpatka> sound?
[12:01:12] <H8BUSTAcap> may have eaten a grenade somewhere there not very healthy
[12:01:40] <KenwoodTom> is it possible to fit a grenade in your mouth to ingest it?
[12:01:52] <KenwoodTom> *DO NOT TEST THIS, IT WAS HYPOTHETICAL
[12:01:56] <+99_goat> He went down to 39 when the round started and the caster didn’t notife
[12:02:09] <KenwoodTom> but if you did test it you'd get a Darwin Award
[12:02:11] <+99_goat> @kenwoodtom depends what grenade
[12:02:18] <+epicpatka> lower caster volume, raise game volume please
[12:02:22] <+99_goat> And how big your mouth and throat is
[12:02:29] <H8BUSTAcap> @KenwoodTom nah you gotta wait and eat it just as it fragments into smaller bits :D
[12:02:36] <+99_goat> Yeah we need more game sound ple
[12:02:38] <KenwoodTom> @99_goat German potato masher :p best type of grenade
[12:02:47] <+99_goat> Lol
[12:03:20] <H8BUSTAcap> gonna be a full save for divizon
[12:03:31] <KenwoodTom> Stielhandgranate should be added to CS for literally no reason other than variety
[12:03:46] <+99_goat> What does it do
[12:04:06] <+epicpatka> dm
[12:04:10] <KenwoodTom> it's just a grenade where the explosive is at the end of a short stick
[12:04:22] <Chemical___> KenwoodTom dont give valve ideas for another case
[12:04:38] <KenwoodTom> was used in ww1 and 2
[12:04:43] <+epicpatka> is chrissK ChisJ's little brother?
[12:04:49] <Chemical___> yup
[12:04:50] <H8BUSTAcap> kzy mopping up the shredded remains of divizons dignity :D
[12:04:56] <JaysWays__> got scammed today for my knife
[12:04:58] <BarnacleRus> nice flash
[12:04:59] <+99_goat> So why is it different than a frag grenade
[12:05:02] <bta666> caster doing good job considering hes solo casting :D
[12:05:12] <KenwoodTom> @Chemical___ why not? Buying cases is stupid no matter what, but at least there would be some cool items added
[12:05:12] <+99_goat> Bruh he totally naded himself earlier lol
[12:05:41] <hiddeN_N> deutschland gegen deutschland
[12:05:45] <KenwoodTom> @99_goat I have no idea how it's different other than shape & triggering mechanism but it's cool, alright >.<
[12:05:51] <H8BUSTAcap> that should make the highlight reel :P
[12:05:54] <+99_goat> Lol
[12:06:15] <+99_goat> Maybe if they made grenade skins it could be a skin for the frag
[12:06:18] <+epicpatka> says nothing for entire round, then patrick and light only two alive
[12:06:27] <KenwoodTom> @Valve please add air support to CSGO >.<
[12:06:54] <Skeetley> lmao killstreaks in csgo
[12:07:00] <+epicpatka> why is the defuse bar not synced with the blowup bar????
[12:07:01] <KenwoodTom> :p
[12:07:04] <David__legend> ez
[12:07:10] <+99_goat> *gets 25k no deaths*
[12:07:19] <+epicpatka> not even proportunate
[12:07:21] <Skeetley> oof
[12:07:21] <KenwoodTom> @Skeetley they wouldn't even need to hire a voice actor, they could just use the dota 2 ones
[12:07:23] <+99_goat> TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING
[12:07:33] <KenwoodTom> lol
[12:07:41] <Skeetley> lets uh, not do that
[12:07:48] <KenwoodTom> xD
[12:08:06] <+99_goat> @valve that was sarcastic I know you usually can’t tell xd
[12:08:16] <Skeetley> if you thought smurfs were bad before just wait until they have tactical nukes
[12:08:27] <KenwoodTom> what about they add that CoD feature where you derank if you get knifed
[12:08:28] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[12:08:34] <+99_goat> Well it would end the game sooner
[12:08:34] <crazymotherd> idiots
[12:08:37] <KenwoodTom> @Skeetley hadn't thought about that- oshit
[12:08:39] <+johnballhand> the timing on that peak was unreal
[12:08:56] <+99_goat> It would be like an automatic surrender @skeetley
[12:09:16] <+johnballhand> i think chrissk likes purp
[12:09:22] <KenwoodTom> Smurfing is an asshole move though, just ruins the game for newer players
[12:09:50] <+99_goat> Better than cheating, still bad tho
[12:09:56] <KenwoodTom> yeah
[12:09:56] <Skeetley> yeah its already bad but when its raining nukes then Silver rank is gonna be hell
[12:10:04] <+99_goat> Lol
[12:10:17] <BajoOoz0Rd> if divizon lose this round, its over for them
[12:10:21] <KenwoodTom> 3 worst sins in CS: 1) hacks, 2) smurfs 3) griefing
[12:10:38] <+99_goat> Griefing would be 2
[12:10:52] <KenwoodTom> only so much dmg you can do by griefing
[12:11:05] <KenwoodTom> team can kick you, or the game will auto kick
[12:11:06] <H8BUSTAcap> well... they shouldnt win this round rly its an eco for them the hope would be to grab some rifles and utility and save
[12:11:13] <Douviid> what is griefing
[12:11:28] <+Lemo200> i think griefing is worst than smurphing
[12:11:29] <KenwoodTom> @Douviid sabotaging your own team
[12:11:30] <+99_goat> Trying to lose
[12:11:31] <Elmazzypro> doing wrong things about your team
[12:11:40] <Skeetley> as someone who has spent over 500 hours in silver 1 id like to say that smurfs and hackers are definetly worse
[12:11:50] <Elmazzypro> like shoot them or give enemy team guns
[12:12:00] <+99_goat> Mmmmm
[12:12:01] <+Lemo200> @Skeetley i feel you
[12:12:17] <KenwoodTom> @Lemo200 you can control the damage that griefing does by kicking people, you cannot kick the other team for smurfing
[12:12:29] <+99_goat> @skeetley smurfs are good players that just got bored of their own rank and want to play easy games, they’re not trying to get you mar
[12:12:40] <+99_goat> *mad
[12:13:05] <KenwoodTom> @99_goat sure, but they're still assholes who ruin the game for us newer/lower level players
[12:13:11] <+Lemo200> @KenwoodTom that's true... but u are playin' 4v5 anyway
[12:13:16] <+99_goat> Griefers are usually shit players that blame the game for them being bad and since they hate the game they ruin it for everyone else
[12:13:25] <Skeetley> a smurf and a hacker can do stuff like ace your team with a single clip of a deagle, where griefers cant do anything that bad, and they can be kicked
[12:13:29] <KenwoodTom> @Lemo200 says who xD
[12:13:33] <H8BUSTAcap> yea... but how do people get better at a game that they are playing when most people at their rank play like bots but every team has a god tier player?
[12:13:58] <BarnacleRus> omg
[12:14:00] <+99_goat> Idk man I’ve learned a lot of things from Smurfs not go a lie
[12:14:07] <DamHillPoker> @H8BUSTAcap u only get better play playing people better than u
[12:14:08] <d3monk1ng> why team shot
[12:14:08] <acdec34> whahahahaha
[12:14:17] <cHeRiF09> xD
[12:14:21] <KenwoodTom> @99_goat depends how much of an asshole they are, and whether they're on your team
[12:14:34] <KenwoodTom> everyone loves a cheater/smurf if he's on their team
[12:14:44] <Skeetley> ive learned how to die better, thats about all i got from smurfs
[12:14:46] <DamHillPoker> I play face it and got my shit pushed in for a long long time and it made me much better at the game
[12:14:47] <H8BUSTAcap> @DamHillPoker not rly cuz the other 4 players on your team devolve into stomping their feet and crying hax... its a team game.
[12:14:53] <+johnballhand> watch your replays, and compare it to a better player, that's the only thing you need to do to improve
[12:15:02] <DamHillPoker> but it makes u better as a player
[12:15:12] <YaNyX3> Zzz team shot
[12:15:12] <+99_goat> @johnballhand not the only thing
[12:15:22] <DamHillPoker> go play face it or esea and ull enjoy the game more
[12:15:22] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[12:15:28] <+Lemo200> having a cheater in team is a waste of time, sooner or later the match will be flagged as played by a cheater and therefore invalid
[12:15:32] <KenwoodTom> @DamHillPoker I have found the opposite, I got better by playing alone and forcing myself to step up & carry games
[12:15:44] <dlaciebiepanmjenskovitz> cs:go dead game mayor 1k viewers LUL
[12:15:48] <BarnacleRus> LUL
[12:15:59] <KenwoodTom> @dlaciebiepanmjenskovitz it's not a major you nut
[12:16:00] <+99_goat> @johnballhand watching good played is not going to make your actual aim better, maybe your crosshair placement, but not your aim
[12:16:06] <+johnballhand> @99_goat if you don't see what you're doing wrong you won't ever change
[12:16:23] <+99_goat> I didn’t say it didn’t do anything I said it’s not the only thing...
[12:16:26] <Skeetley> lol i know what im doing wrong, im getting killed
[12:16:34] <dlaciebiepanmjenskovitz> also wtf is Minecraft spring
[12:16:34] <+Lemo200> XD
[12:16:38] <KenwoodTom> lol
[12:16:43] <+99_goat> @skeetley much more complicated than that lmfwo
[12:17:02] <+Ipxcrankzz> gg euronics win
[12:17:09] <KenwoodTom> I know what I'm doing wrong- I'm getting matched up with silvers who, despite me getting 40 kills, still lose the game
[12:17:24] <Skeetley> if i just didnt die then i wouldnt be as bad
[12:17:25] <H8BUSTAcap> lol why are you getting killed are you re peeking not using utility are you not using your teammates to set up advantageous fights?
[12:17:28] <KenwoodTom> that only happened twice but still, both my recent losses were like that
[12:17:30] <+johnballhand> a dude who spends 1k hours on 1v1/ aim maps etc vs a guy who knows the map like the back of his hand
[12:17:35] <DamHillPoker> @KenwoodTom maybe ur gettign kills but not actually doign anythign to win the rounds
[12:17:50] <Skeetley> im getting shot, not much to say about it
[12:17:53] <dlaciebiepanmjenskovitz> doing nothing*
[12:17:54] <+99_goat> @kenwoodtom yes you are right, what you’re doing wrong is solo queing
[12:17:59] <KenwoodTom> @DamHillPoker eh, I was the only one who could aim, I tried calling shots on T side and got ignored
[12:18:12] <Skeetley> im just playing the game and then boom a smurf kills me
[12:18:19] <DamHillPoker> @KenwoodTom yeah some times that shit just happens been there many times
[12:18:20] <KenwoodTom> @99_goat yeah but my friends talk too much so I cant concentrate when I play with them
[12:18:23] <darkspirit_de> Mp9 OP
[12:18:28] <DamHillPoker> like i said guys play faceit or esea much better games
[12:18:31] <+99_goat> Oof same @kenwoodtom
[12:18:37] <+Lemo200> @KenwoodTom nobody gives calls on t side in silver, that's for sure
[12:18:42] <+mr_mooo1002> @kenwoodtom try to get a Team
[12:18:44] <KenwoodTom> @99 what rank are you?
[12:18:53] <H8BUSTAcap> solo Que just yell "Clear comms" and mute people who dont know what that means xD
[12:18:59] <+99_goat> I had to show them how fun it is to win while being concentrated for them to start trying
[12:19:03] <KenwoodTom> @Lemo200 I'm not a silver XD not quite anyway
[12:19:13] <+99_goat> @kenwoodtom lem
[12:19:17] <KenwoodTom> @mr_mooo1002 yeh, maybe
[12:19:41] <KenwoodTom> @99_goat welp, was hoping we could play together :p I'm gn1 cos I haven't played in 3 months
[12:19:45] <+Lemo200> i said that because in mm i'm silver, i talk by my experience XD
[12:20:07] <+99_goat> Do you live in USA @kenwoodtom
[12:20:17] <KenwoodTom> @99_goat nah, I'm a Brit
[12:20:18] <Skeetley> feels bad to be silver
[12:20:32] <Skeetley> i have 527 hours and 40 comp wins and im still silver 1
[12:20:34] <+99_goat> Oh I live in USA so we still would’ve lagged if we played
[12:20:53] <Skeetley> i hate silver so much
[12:20:59] <+99_goat> @skeetley do you have a bad computer/mouse?
[12:21:02] <+johnballhand> if you enjoy playing skeetley then its cool
[12:21:21] <+Lemo200> @Skeetley HAHAAHAHAA 900h almost 200 wins, still silver
[12:21:31] <Skeetley> i got terrible internet but everything else is fine. also i suck so that's probably it
[12:21:32] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[12:21:37] <+dabsforglory> 4k hours 0 comp matches feels good
[12:21:55] <+99_goat> How much FPS do u get @skeetley
[12:22:14] <Skeetley> usually like 30
[12:22:19] <H8BUSTAcap> lol
[12:22:21] <+99_goat> That’s not good lol
[12:22:37] <+99_goat> @skeetley you have all your settings all the way down righthe
[12:23:17] <Skeetley> anything above 20 fps all looks the same to me. nah it aint all down, just like half of it
[12:23:30] <H8BUSTAcap> graphics< performance
[12:23:36] <miguelcomander> wtf
[12:23:39] <+99_goat> Bruh trust me no one can get out of silver with 20 fps
[12:23:47] <+johnballhand> i think what some people need to realise is that it's a game and games are systems that we build to enjoy ourselves in... and if we suck at it but it's fun then it doesn't matter
[12:23:50] <miguelcomander> allways in low to boost the performance
[12:24:06] <+99_goat> You do not need any of those settings up except for the resolution not being too low
[12:24:17] <henkiedezesde> ez win 4 euro
[12:24:49] <+Ern1e123> Im MG1 with around 500 hours
[12:24:56] <+johnballhand> @KenwoodTom every MM experience in cs is trash at ANY rank
[12:25:10] <H8BUSTAcap> there are a lot of trolls in MM and also alot of people who just dont understand what "competitive" means.
[12:25:16] <+99_goat> Lem isn’t that bad @johnballhand
[12:25:17] <+Lemo200> AGREE
[12:25:48] <+johnballhand> @99_goat bru you're na you wouldnt understand the russian struggle
[12:25:53] <Skeetley> oof i wish i could just git gud at csgo cause then i might actually enjoy it but eh, i guess ill just stay silver forever at this point
[12:26:02] <+johnballhand> @KenwoodTom welcome to cs

[12:26:16] <+99_goat> @skeetley dude you need to turn your settings down lol

[12:26:32] <Clayney0> germans LUL
[12:26:54] <H8BUSTAcap> oh and fps does matter a lot my friend did a human benchmark test on his 60hrz screen and then on his 144hrz screen and halved his reaction time.
[12:27:08] <Skeetley> i mean i think my internet and reaction time are whats holing me back mostly, my aim aint too bad im just slow with slow internet
[12:27:19] <+99_goat> @skeetley it’s very common knowledge that those settings being up give you no advantage except for resolution
[12:27:31] <+Lemo200> the term "human benchmark" scares me
[12:27:40] <knzx86> tu nao sabe narra nao?
[12:27:43] <+johnballhand> @Skeetley play aim maps ( 1v1 and spray pattern stuff), watch your replays, correct the errors you notice, find some friends and play with them, learn together etc
[12:27:53] <+99_goat> @skeetley honestly if you have 20 FPS you might think it’s your reaction time but they show up on your screen way to late and laggy if you get 20 fps
[12:27:56] <+johnballhand> @Skeetley once you're a bit more comfortable play faceit
[12:27:58] <+dabsforglory> human benchmark lol
[12:28:24] <Skeetley> my reaction time is like 0.45 seconds lol, im legitimately slow
[12:28:34] <+johnballhand> in general the human eye caps at around 150-200hz refresh rate
[12:28:55] <+Ern1e123> The problem is when u play with people that are holding u back and ca`nt improve bc they r legit getting 1 kill every game LUL
[12:29:00] <+99_goat> That’s a rumor not a fact
[12:29:16] <+johnballhand> @99_goat read a study on it, had a fairly decent sample size
[12:29:20] <+Lemo200> i feel comfortable at 60capped 60hrz
[12:29:22] <+dabsforglory> no
[12:29:33] <denson12> eco guys eco
[12:29:40] <+99_goat> It doesn’t cap but the difference becomes very small
[12:29:55] <H8BUSTAcap> @Skeetley wow... my friend is inhuman and has like a 174ms reaction time or something he is an awesome sniper.
[12:29:55] <+Lemo200> i'm i the only one who gets a grange feeling at 144?
