[2:49:57] <CallMeNuke> KennyS isn't the best awper anymore...
[2:49:59] <+Wizoch> and they think we don't hete them enough either.
[2:50:18] <Zyfermars> wait this is a replay right?
[2:50:36] <caiobtorres> technically maybe not, but i still think he is the clutchier
[2:50:45] <CallMeNuke> ...
[2:50:47] <mindless_deniz> OMG ESL WHY
[2:50:59] <CallMeNuke> But Guardian has way higher consistancy.
[2:51:07] <daceher> ads
[2:51:41] <caiobtorres> whats your lineup?
[2:51:51] <caiobtorres> who would it be
[2:51:55] <caiobtorres> this one is just mine
[2:52:00] <CallMeNuke> Faze but trade Niko for S1mple.
[2:52:04] <caiobtorres> but i agree that the awper could be either guardian or fallen
[2:52:18] <caiobtorres> kkkk
[2:52:30] <caiobtorres> no cold?
[2:52:45] <CallMeNuke> Your lineup isn't terrible, but its a legend lineup...
[2:53:06] <CallMeNuke> They all had great legendary plays. And they are only remembered for it
[2:53:20] <mindless_deniz> cold is too overrated
[2:53:34] <flergyhergy> kenny s ;)
[2:53:39] <mindless_deniz> even rain is better then him
[2:54:02] <CallMeNuke> I.E. Simple's heaven noscope, Cold's jump shots. Kenny WAS a god.
[2:54:30] <mind51> olof gonem
[2:54:45] <mind51> is olof gone?
[2:54:52] <flergyhergy> Kenny revolutionized the way people used the awp
[2:54:52] <CallMeNuke> No
[2:55:06] <CallMeNuke> Was just subbed out, he couldnt make the major.
[2:55:08] <mind51> @flergyhergy , and then the awp got nerfed
[2:55:28] <mind51> @callmenuke thanks:)
[2:55:30] <CallMeNuke> Kenny brought quickscoping to CSGO. Thats it.

[18:26:33] <Sinistersock0> so do you think tyloo were cheaters?
[18:26:59] <Sherlockeed> Who won this game
[18:27:09] <Sinistersock0> tyloo
[18:27:10] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> Are you only saying that cuz they're chinese? lol
[18:27:11] <+Senkolicious> 100% tylo
[18:27:35] <Sinistersock0> i guess im just saying it becasue they came a bit out of nowhere
[18:27:37] <epicethangamer75> cloud9 is not the same without stewie
[18:27:44] <+Senkolicious> new c9 is garbo now FeelsBadMan
[18:27:47] <epicethangamer75> :(
[18:27:48] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> way too true
[18:27:49] <guidotto> EntropyWins
[18:27:49] <Sinistersock0> no evidently they arent
[18:28:05] <Sinistersock0> tyloo also beat a bunch of good teams though
[18:28:09] <SalamanderJo> Tarik needs to become the new stew
[18:28:21] <+Senkolicious> tf
[18:28:21] <Sherlockeed> From major to garbage
[18:28:32] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> Imagine if Hiko was still there with Stewie?
[18:28:34] <+Senkolicious> auto mod for no swear word?!?!?!?!?!
[18:28:51] <Sherlockeed> Their motivation is gone since they won championship
[18:28:53] <Sinistersock0> yeah the auto mod is pretty strict
[18:28:58] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> oof
[18:29:05] <+Senkolicious> tf ESL
[18:29:06] <SalamanderJo> used to have god players till they took garbage players from other lower ranked American teams
[18:29:08] <Sinistersock0> do we think sk will come back?
[18:29:20] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> maybe
[18:29:43] <Sinistersock0> they had such a shocking iem syd
[18:30:04] <creativcek> they need time
[18:30:37] <Sherlockeed> Whos number1 team rght now
[18:30:49] <Sinistersock0> also do you think greyhound will continue to be good?
[18:30:57] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> Anyone think Freakazoid should've stayed? Or they fine without him and the whole Bullyzoid controversy
[18:31:07] <Sinistersock0> i think at the moment the top team is either astralis or faze
[18:31:28] <SalamanderJo> i think sk or faze
[18:31:40] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> Tyloo is definitely a rising team too for that number 1 seed
[18:32:45] <Sinistersock0> id agree with sk a few months ago but they have been doing very poorly recently, were astralis have been bulldozing everything, except for faze
[18:32:51] <Espresso_wang> why freakazoid left?
[18:33:26] <v14AlMtRoOo3> tyloo wins right ?
[18:33:34] <Sinistersock0> yeah
[18:33:39] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> I honestly dont remember, it's been about more than a year since Freak left C9
[18:33:40] <Verticuse> no spoilers
[18:33:44] <twitchmademedoitjk> freak said he didnt want to play with needle arm teammates
[18:34:07] <Sinistersock0> what do you mean by needle arm?
[18:34:12] <Verticuse> and what does that mean may i ask?
[18:34:16] <Hi_im_Otton> haHAA
[18:34:21] <twitchmademedoitjk> scrawny
[18:34:22] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> like they only play hand movemet and not their whole arm
[18:34:51] <Verticuse> and why does it matter
[18:35:04] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> seems arm movement is more stable than jitter hands
[18:35:05] <Verticuse> many players play with wrist only
[18:35:05] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[18:35:18] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> but it's only by opinion
[18:35:29] <Sinistersock0> so was he insinuating that they dodgy?
[18:35:51] <Verticuse> wrist only movement is very ez especially with edpi of above 800
[18:35:57] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> idk, all I know is he went to Echo Fox and that turned great now didnt it lol
[18:36:05] <Sinistersock0> yeah i doubt i move my whole arm
[18:36:08] <Verticuse> EDPI = Effective DPI BTW
[18:36:08] <v14AlMtRoOo3> all those needle arms play better than him rly
[18:36:27] <pcmasteras> BUNE AK KOLSUZLARI
[18:37:09] <Verticuse> i play with edpi of 1000 and use wrist only
[18:37:17] <Sinistersock0> can you arm someone with an awp?
[18:37:28] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> potentially
[18:37:43] <Verticuse> i can easily awp
[18:37:52] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> but wrist imo is better than arm playstyle
[18:37:53] <Sinistersock0> like straight through the elbow but not a kill?
[18:38:07] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> OH you meant that
[18:38:11] <deVzerk> @PuffyMcPuffPuffers u will injure ur wrist trust me
[18:38:17] <proflamm3r> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[18:38:32] <+ompsu> rip
[18:38:33] <Verticuse> my elbow rests on my hand rests
[18:38:34] <+Gallacc> lol wtf?
[18:38:41] <deVzerk> i used to play wrist but due to my profession my wrist couldnt take it so i had to change
[18:38:42] <tinchoow1> ads SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage
[18:38:48] <twitchmademedoitjk> yes, arm is much better than wrist
[18:38:53] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> ads Hahaa
[18:39:09] <+ompsu> adblock SwiftRage SwiftRage
[18:39:16] <+Gallacc> but what ads though? lol i dont get it
[18:39:20] <Verticuse> the problem with arm is the fact that you can get tennis elbow
[18:39:32] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> oof
[18:39:37] <+Gallacc> oh my adblock is blocking it?
[18:39:58] <+ompsu> Yeah
[18:40:00] <Verticuse> wrist players of ten only get minor wrist injuries
[18:40:13] <deVzerk> @Verticuse dont use elbow use shoulder
[18:40:22] <+Gallacc> okay i turned it off. i better see some fkin ads next time :D
[18:40:22] <AdmiralYeoj> ur twitch prime is actually blocking it
[18:40:32] <twitchmademedoitjk> i play with arm and i didnt have problems
[18:40:43] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> I've been doing wrist sunce around roughly 04-05, never had an issue from then to the present
[18:40:44] <eduu016> sk are out?
[18:40:54] <twitchmademedoitjk> and i have been gaming for 15 years
[18:40:57] <SalamanderJo> what is tennis elbow?
[18:41:03] <deVzerk> @PuffyMcPuffPuffers me too expect i work as a mechanic aswell so combined its too much
[18:41:06] <+Gallacc> ah i cant turn off my twitch prime
[18:41:35] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> @devzerk Ah I see
[18:41:53] <twitchmademedoitjk> tennis elbow is when you mess up your tendoin
[18:42:22] <twitchmademedoitjk> by repetitive movement of arm/wrist
[18:42:33] <SalamanderJo> holy
[18:42:38] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> I onl work as an intern right now for a World History meusum, so it doesn't ask much anything arm, let alone walking most of the day
[18:43:03] <twitchmademedoitjk> by doing yourself if you catxh my drift
[18:43:18] <PuffyMcPuffPuffers> *lenny face*
[18:43:28] <deVzerk> @PuffyMcPuffPuffers i stand all day and work on cars so its rly hard on hands. but im applying to uni in 1 month so hopefully can say goodbye to physical work after 6 years xD

[1 day, 18:43:48] <NaBeHobby> i'm just wondering when the next operation is :(
[1 day, 18:43:48] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[1 day, 18:43:51] <hassLaTV> Exactly!
[1 day, 18:44:01] <Rasthan> they don't like it :)
[1 day, 18:44:32] <neverendk> did they choose mirage too?
[1 day, 18:44:39] <Rasthan> idk
[1 day, 18:44:53] <neverendk> they should :p
[1 day, 18:45:08] <scyteh> <o/
[1 day, 18:45:10] <neverendk> it is a CT map tho
[1 day, 18:46:10] <neverendk> think so?
[1 day, 18:46:18] <Rasthan> i'm not sure... depend on team, in my opinion i'm better in T side
[1 day, 18:46:43] <hassLaTV> So if one of the maps are Mirage, then you can be pretty sure that Fnatic picked it to f*ck with G2
[1 day, 18:47:26] <NaBeHobby> getting banned for saying its t sided?
[1 day, 18:47:37] <Rasthan> xDD
[1 day, 18:47:39] <neverendk> o.O
[1 day, 18:47:46] <Rasthan> i was wondering why ^^
