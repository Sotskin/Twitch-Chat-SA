[2:04:29] <Leffimin> @ESL_CSGO are you guys gonna give the event MVP a kebab instead of a trophy?
[2:04:50] <+mrljb> @ESL_CSGO omg please do that
[2:05:10] <kaioto__> let's hope someone doesn't pop a molly in front of trials otherwise it's round over
[2:05:11] <+panda48_> @esl_csgo Get the casters in chat
[2:05:13] <~ESL_CSGO> hmm.. Not the first time ESL has awarded food to winners, might be a first for CS though.
[2:05:16] <Leffimin> @panda48_ The Krew, needs to recruit guys with gamertags affiliated with kebabs
[2:05:28] <PhilipFillop> @ESL_CSGO if you're doing that can we say I joined the winning team?
[2:05:37] <+panda48_> @leffimin Yeah could do
[2:05:45] <MisterJoint420> t-sack sounds cooler than chack
[2:05:52] <+panda48_> I'm happy to be in a backroom role as I'm not much of a player

[2:54:12] <+Varnished> I'm kind of suspect of anyone who is over the age of 16 and still plays videogames ngl
[2:54:28] <Leffimin> @Varnished how old are you?
[2:54:28] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[2:54:34] <IIICaTz> I'm 20 .-.
[2:54:53] <Leffimin> can we get coverage of Leicester vs Brunley instead of the next game?
[2:55:04] <IIICaTz> and i literally just switched internet provider for lower ping in games
[2:55:09] <ilmman> people who make video games are like 20-60 you gotta play games to make games
[2:55:40] <IIICaTz> I plan on continuing to play videogames for a very long time.. obviously I have a job and what not
[2:55:46] <+Varnished> people who make videogames are rubes who work 60 hour weeks for peanuts when they could have 9-5 jobs that pay way more.
[2:55:50] <IIICaTz> just got my own truck so i'd say it's ok for me to play some games
[2:56:07] <ilmman> Ceo of video game companies aint 8 year old too
[2:56:13] <IIICaTz> and i work a decent paying job
[2:56:27] <Leffimin> @Varnished how old are you?!?
[2:56:35] <+Varnished> Seriously you read about people working in videogames being relentlessly exploited but they're programmers who could make 100k never working overtime in another company
[2:56:44] <BoySmileXD> i pley woblox. IM A GAMERRRR
[2:56:56] <+Varnished> Being the CEO of a videogame company doesn't require playing, or even liking videogames tbqh. Its just knowing how to sell a product
[2:56:59] <ilmman> Video games e la serious business
[2:57:11] <IIICaTz> how old are you Varnished
[2:57:43] <Leffimin> @Varnished that's what most jobs are, being the boss of a restaurant doesn't require you having good taste buds
[2:58:23] <+nielsvd145> @Varnished please, your watching a stream of pro players playing a video game
[2:58:26] <Leffimin> like being the director of the nba doesn't require you to even like basketball
[2:59:19] <ilmman> i bet you there are no director like that at all

[5:11:02] <+JVinsant> there is no other shooter to play besides csgo that takes any skill soo whatf we gonna play
[5:11:03] <WrathNL> lel and thats why audi, visa, vodafone, are still sponsoring csgo teams right @willcome_

[5:13:49] <willcome_> pubg not stable but items are 1000s of $ now xD
[5:14:19] <MDubs111> So are rubies and sapphires
[5:14:43] <MDubs111> Boi youre here giving your time to cs right now. Think about that
[5:15:01] <Faylhein> we love cs
[5:15:38] <DHunt2> cs Kreygasm other games EleGiggle
[5:15:51] <+SlyFreaky> @willcome_ the economy is only expensive because of the hype. the game has like 200 skins maybe also......
[5:15:54] <NonShensh> pubg has been losing players for 3 months now for fortnite LUL
[5:16:24] <+SlyFreaky> PubG isn't even a game to compare to csgo.. theres no game like csgo has no competition for market only player base.
[5:16:27] <gormett> I thought it was because of the streamers who complained about stream sniping and the unoptimization
[5:16:31] <inspire_asy> if fortnite 1$ dollars no one play fornite
[5:16:49] <GoodyPundit> Kreygasm where's ur kreygasm boiz
[5:16:56] <gormett> Or it would be the best buy ever
[5:17:00] <tomatotom> csgo is not an unoptimized game, source engine is just bad with lighting but of source games it is best

[5:17:39] <vapor1> @inspire_asy ur logic is same as if toilet paper was $15 no one would buy to wipe their ass
[5:17:45] <Hayd12345> AHAHAHA
[5:17:45] <Pivel_> a potato can run csgo so only trolls say its unoptimized LUL
[5:17:58] <Jossif1> or poor plebs
[5:18:05] <inspire_asy> no man it is really true , pubg is so expensive thats why
[5:18:11] <+Holopferd> or console peasants
[5:18:16] <DHunt2> ofc if fortnite costs $1 they have a game fan base... fortnite add minecraft in battle royale... a dream for 12 years old children around the world Kappa
