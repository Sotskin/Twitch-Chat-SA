[11:49:13] <PurpIeYoshi> aye
[11:50:04] <CayteaCrisis> Never played, like to watch :3
[11:51:10] <PurpIeYoshi> i watch more than i play nowadays but when you play you understand the game more tho
[11:51:36] <CayteaCrisis> I just like watching people shoot each other xD
[11:52:00] <CayteaCrisis> Less permanent on a game than in real life.
[11:52:08] <+fearofhell> tru
[11:52:51] <PurpIeYoshi> thats for sure
[11:55:03] <PurpIeYoshi> Favorite team?
[11:55:33] <+fearofhell> always and forever VP
[11:55:37] <CayteaCrisis> I have to say FaZe is a strong favorite of mine
[11:56:04] <+zzeuss> Sk
[11:56:18] <CayteaCrisis> SK is a good team along with VP
[11:56:37] <+fearofhell> I wouldn't go so far as to call VP a good team but I love them anyway
[11:56:51] <CayteaCrisis> It's just certain teams are better with certain maps, and they can just sweep a win with no problem
[11:57:06] <PurpIeYoshi> yeah i love them but like nowadays i feel like vp falling down
[11:57:12] <CayteaCrisis> That and good leadership
[11:57:45] <Kryne1188> mah na standingup
[11:59:12] <+Bob123427> im streaming fortnite right now
[11:59:23] <CayteaCrisis> VP might need to trade some players out, because they've become way too comfortable with expecting wins with their classic teamates
[11:59:33] <+fearofhell> ^
[11:59:45] <PurpIeYoshi> idk they have well balanced players
[11:59:47] <CayteaCrisis> Who cares, Bob, we're here for CS:GO.
[11:59:48] <+fearofhell> I love their lineup, and their personalities, they just aren't winning
[12:00:11] <PurpIeYoshi> they should change their playstyle
[12:00:45] <CayteaCrisis> They need to have more than one playstyle in order to diversify how they approach a map.
[12:01:08] <PurpIeYoshi> yeah causs i think in mirage they keep getting swept
[12:01:21] <CayteaCrisis> They do, and it's showing
[12:02:03] <PurpIeYoshi> they have potential
[12:02:27] <CayteaCrisis> But they have to build up on that potential in order to actually win on Mirage.
[12:03:00] <PurpIeYoshi> yeah true, but it isnt easy as it seems
[12:03:05] <+fearofhell> Whatever happened to Hiko anyways? He was a really decent player a few years back
[12:03:54] <PurpIeYoshi> its been a while ive heard of him.. he still in a team?
[12:04:18] <+fearofhell> not sure
[12:04:23] <CayteaCrisis> I haven't seen or heard anything about him, I thought he was still with his team. Just less air time.
[12:04:37] <PurpIeYoshi> lemme check real quick
[12:05:08] <+VashOnHash> Nice save Keepo
[12:05:51] <PurpIeYoshi> it says hes playing for a team called rogue
[12:06:14] <+fearofhell> oooh okay
[12:06:25] <PurpIeYoshi> probably semi-pro idk
[12:06:27] <mamx29> LUL
[12:06:34] <CayteaCrisis> Rogue? Never heard of them.
[12:06:34] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[12:06:48] <PurpIeYoshi> same xD
[12:07:02] <+fearofhell> yeah if I recall it's like a tier 2-3 team
[12:07:24] <CayteaCrisis> They have to be trying to build a strong team to compete in higher tier tournaments.
[12:07:45] <PurpIeYoshi> Yup
[12:07:49] <CayteaCrisis> Hiko is more than likely their best player right now.
[12:08:21] <PurpIeYoshi> look at faze and SK amazing players... but I think Hiko left the pro league is cause he wasnt feeling it
[12:08:21] <+fearofhell> I always thought Hiko was one of the better NA players back in the day, surprised to see him on a lower tier team
[12:08:46] <CayteaCrisis> He also might be taking a break from the pressure of a tier 1 team
[12:08:54] <+fearofhell> tru
[12:08:56] <PurpIeYoshi> yeah thats most likely
[12:10:06] <PurpIeYoshi> i feel pressure when i play normal pug imagine on stage live LUL
[12:10:28] <+fearofhell> I feel pressure when I play an mm and underperform lol
[12:10:40] <PurpIeYoshi> exactly üòÇ
[12:11:03] <CayteaCrisis> I feel like any game I play that deals with shooting makes me shit my pants and quit immediately :'D
[12:11:39] <PurpIeYoshi> soo you havent been a mw2 fan i suppose? xD
[12:11:54] <PurpIeYoshi> before csgo that was the good stuff back in the days
[12:12:01] <+fearofhell> ugh, mw2 was my first steam game, put wayyyy too many hours into that
[12:12:08] <CayteaCrisis> No, I couldn't even get through Black Ops without wanting to curse everyone out xD
[12:12:25] <jbg0625> HeyGuys
[12:12:47] <PurpIeYoshi> oh yeah black ops be toxic tho lol
[12:13:09] <CayteaCrisis> It's funny when it's everyone but me raging at the game
[12:13:13] <PurpIeYoshi> wassup jbg
[12:13:13] <+fearofhell> Well @PurpIeYoshi and @CayteaCrisis ya'll were real fun to chill with, have yourselves a good one HeyGuys
[12:13:25] <+fearofhell> im out for now
[12:13:28] <CayteaCrisis> Night @fearofhell
[12:13:43] <PurpIeYoshi> fear add me you cool dawg
[12:13:59] <PurpIeYoshi> ttyl
[12:14:19] <+fearofhell> ttyl
[12:14:33] <PurpIeYoshi> im not really that toxic tbh
[12:14:58] <PurpIeYoshi> only if like my teamates sucks üòÇ
[12:15:03] <CayteaCrisis> Don't you know that purple is a toxic color in the wild? Kappa
[12:15:33] <PurpIeYoshi> yeahh but thats beside the point LUL
[12:15:46] <CayteaCrisis> Same here, but there were worse players than me and I always wished they'd die quickly LUL
[12:16:43] <PurpIeYoshi> Yeah üòÇ
[12:17:08] <CayteaCrisis> That or I wished Friendly Fire was an option
[12:17:30] <CayteaCrisis> Dock my score, I don't care, just get them away from me D;
[12:17:53] <PurpIeYoshi> well in call of duty you got hardcore mode you can shoot allies and well csgo.. yeah LUL
[12:18:32] <CayteaCrisis> Yeah, but then I'D be killed in HC mode.
[12:19:02] <PurpIeYoshi> aye its alright
[12:19:40] <CayteaCrisis> Yeah, but still
[12:19:58] <PurpIeYoshi> Btw what do you think of stew leaving c9 to sk? which is a brasilian team?
[12:20:15] <PurpIeYoshi> and anyway call of duty is dead nowadays LUL
[12:20:50] <Modyghost> adsad
[12:21:17] <mamx29> lol round 18 nice ad rolling LUL
[12:21:31] <CayteaCrisis> It's kind of a toss up for me really, because C9 was good, but SK is better. C9 could've really tried to dominate if they tried, but SK has already shown how strong of a pro-league team they are.
[12:22:09] <PurpIeYoshi> gotta get that money LUL and i agree. stew said he left cause he felt sk was better and theyre always trying to do their best
[12:22:30] <PurpIeYoshi> C9 even if he won a championship he didnt felt that energy
[12:22:44] <CayteaCrisis> Exactly, and C9 is still fimbling trying to find where their strengths are in their own team members.
[12:22:44] <mamx29> but sk have to speak english now because of him. it's a double edge knife
[12:23:33] <CayteaCrisis> Well, English is one of the most widely spoken languages past Mandarin so it's a plus for the team.
[12:23:54] <PurpIeYoshi> Yup..
[12:23:54] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[12:24:11] <mamx29> not that of a plus. they can sometime chocking because of that
[12:24:11] <PurpIeYoshi> !uptime
[12:24:12] <@Moobot> @PurpIeYoshi Uptime is: 12h 24m 20s
[12:25:26] <CayteaCrisis> It'll be a transition for Stew and SK, but they'll eventually learn how to communicate with one another effectively. They can't just speak Portuguese and hope Stew knows what they're saying.
[12:25:47] <PurpIeYoshi> Alot of those teams have potential i cant wait for summer tournament
[12:26:02] <PurpIeYoshi> and most of SK speaks english shouldnt be that bad
[12:26:15] <CayteaCrisis> Same here, it's going to me a massacre if FaZe and SK go head to head.
[12:26:43] <PurpIeYoshi> that would be an insane matchup
[12:27:01] <mamx29> I still hope for s1mple get a first Major champion with Navi.
[12:27:05] <CayteaCrisis> That'd be a matchup for the ages
[12:27:42] <PurpIeYoshi> s1mple is good but aint heard nothing good of Navi lately
[12:28:03] <mamx29> Yah, that the problem
[12:28:08] <CayteaCrisis> Nope, they're team just hasn't been in it lately
[12:28:33] <mamx29> Navi have no clear strat at all, they depending in s1mple too much
[12:29:03] <PurpIeYoshi> Theyre washed up.. like Nip.. used to be my fav team too
[12:29:22] <CayteaCrisis> They need to find their strengths like C9 needs too, and then focus on rotation until their entire team is rounded out.
[12:29:47] <mamx29> They are getting back bit by bit, but still not enough.
[12:30:05] <PurpIeYoshi> if C9 finds their strengths and weaknesses as much as Navi they would be insane no joke
[12:30:16] <CayteaCrisis> Nip is a tragic loss. They used to be one of my favorites as well.
[12:30:49] <PurpIeYoshi> im just mad that theyre is alot of good players who are in teams who are "bad".. and yeah its sad..
[12:30:55] <CayteaCrisis> They could get right behind FaZe or SK, but they'd have to build their skills more to match them.
[12:30:55] <mamx29> C9 LUL first nothing and shround, now ska
[12:31:20] <PurpIeYoshi> they also lost stewie
[12:31:38] <CayteaCrisis> Yeah, and Stew was one of their better players.
[12:31:50] <Onurberke2626> Liquid Win
[12:31:54] <PurpIeYoshi> they have tarik tho.. huge leader and entry fraggers
[12:32:17] <mamx29> He didn't shine much in the Major, nut he still 1 of the key player
[12:32:17] <CayteaCrisis> Liquid is making a comeback, but Renegades could pull ahead again.
[12:32:48] <+Bob123427> come check me out im streaming fortnite
[12:32:55] <PurpIeYoshi> yeah true.. and yeah its anybody's game rn but the money is a big difference

[12:35:33] <PurpIeYoshi> i mean thats logic aint it üòÇ
[12:35:44] <mamx29> Like my overwatch is now full of cheeter
[12:36:01] <CayteaCrisis> Find a wall and try walking through it, Yoshi LUL
[12:36:09] <igorzarkov> did someone know why is no skins on csgo bet sites? there is only pubg to withdraw
[12:36:34] <mamx29> Cause Valve patched it few days ago
[12:36:35] <PurpIeYoshi> sure thing üòÇ and idk try another site
[12:36:35] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[12:36:58] <mamx29> They change trading system
[12:36:59] <igorzarkov> what that means patched it?
[12:37:22] <igorzarkov> is this bad?
[12:37:23] <mamx29> It take a week for item to be trade now
[12:37:34] <CayteaCrisis> That sucks...
[12:37:43] <PurpIeYoshi> they did this soo less change of scam?
[12:38:00] <igorzarkov> i went from daily 0.20‚Ç¨ to 40‚Ç¨ and i need to withdraw stupid pubg skin
[12:38:01] <mamx29> Is the dead for all betting site
[12:38:02] <CayteaCrisis> More than likely if they were getting a lot of scam reports
[12:38:33] <igorzarkov> are they goin to fix this?
[12:38:48] <PurpIeYoshi> i mean i think theyre trying to shut down betting sites since its easy to make money in those
[12:38:53] <mamx29> no, they want to stop all betting in csgo
[12:38:54] <CayteaCrisis> Usually, the changes are permanent
[12:39:06] <SkyTech6> This is their fix XD
[12:39:11] <PurpIeYoshi> and im not sure if theyre getting money by those betting sites
[12:39:13] <mamx29> since you cant bet your item when it take 1 week to trade again
[12:39:15] <igorzarkov> but why maan
[12:39:30] <PurpIeYoshi> they want money lmao
[12:39:34] <igorzarkov> that thing is kinda dumb btw
[12:39:43] <SkyTech6> cause gambling sites are unethical?
[12:39:53] <CayteaCrisis> If they want money, open their own betting site.
[12:39:54] <Gpiresjr> Cad√™ o taco?
[12:39:54] <mamx29> Scam report dude
[12:40:10] <ZarekGod> ?
[12:40:15] <igorzarkov> gambling is for those who cant afford better skins cmoon volvo
[12:40:18] <CayteaCrisis> Take a percentage from what is bet.
[12:41:19] <igorzarkov> i need to buy that pubg
[12:41:33] <igorzarkov> but its 30 euros man
[12:41:37] <CayteaCrisis> Pubg even came to mobile ffs
[12:41:48] <PurpIeYoshi> dont spent money on that
[12:42:11] <PurpIeYoshi> ive played it and ive been a fan of it but like you get bored of it easily
[12:42:20] <mamx29> Yeah Pubg suck by now
[12:42:33] <mamx29> the skin price not gonna be that high for long
[12:42:38] <CayteaCrisis> Pubg is free on mobile -_-
[12:42:42] <PurpIeYoshi> the maps are way too big and not enough players
[12:42:54] <PurpIeYoshi> yeah but on mobile pubg is real bad
[12:43:16] <CayteaCrisis> It's why I haven't downloaded it despite the #1 status on it
[12:43:23] <PurpIeYoshi> they wanted to put it on mobile real quick soo they didnt take care of glitches and everything
[12:43:40] <PurpIeYoshi> you can get skins but its useless
[12:43:48] <CayteaCrisis> Yeah, they'll try to fix them down the line despite not having a beta release
[12:44:13] <mamx29> Bad optimize, item sell with high price, and most of the game is hide and seek
[12:44:28] <PurpIeYoshi> yup and you mostly run away from the circle
[12:44:49] <CayteaCrisis> When you're supposed to run towards it
[12:46:00] <PurpIeYoshi> its just a waste of money and igor i think even if they shut them down, people are still gon put new sites up
[12:46:54] <mamx29> Pubg is good if you have friend and play squad tho.
[12:46:56] <JCAlcapone> just forget PUBG, there is ROE OF ELYSIUM, JUST GOOGLE URSLELF AND GO PLAY IT, ITS ALMOST BUG FREE AND BETTER THAN PUBG. i forgot, its also a FREE GAME
[12:46:56] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[12:46:57] <CayteaCrisis> Yep, and they'll do like pirate movie sites: switch url each time in order to keep hiding.
[12:47:29] <CayteaCrisis> Go walk off a cliff, JCA.
[12:48:00] <PurpIeYoshi> Soo toxic Caytea, he tryna advertise LUL
[12:48:07] <JCAlcapone> pubg sheep
[12:48:18] <JCAlcapone> i just tell this kids good game
[12:48:24] <CayteaCrisis> I know, but he doesn't see that I'd rather shank him than look that game up LUL
[12:48:40] <PurpIeYoshi> Lmao üòÇ
[12:48:54] <CayteaCrisis> xD
[12:48:59] <PurpIeYoshi> JCA no hate tho all love LUL
[12:49:00] <JCAlcapone> ur like america, ignorant actions
[12:49:27] <CayteaCrisis> I'm like America, I hate my own country and the president makes me wanna die LUL
[12:49:49] <PurpIeYoshi> Im happy too be Canadian LUL
[12:49:55] <mamx29> Like the shit happen in Syria right now LUL ?
[12:50:05] <CayteaCrisis> I like Canada too, lets trade Kappa
[12:50:30] <JCAlcapone> syria is just one more planted plot so they can "democratise"
[12:50:35] <PurpIeYoshi> Nah id rather stay here, we dont like trump ugly lookin' ass
[12:50:44] <CayteaCrisis> Syria is a stockpile or shit and piss right now lol
[12:51:05] <mamx29> It's alway about oil and money
[12:51:06] <PurpIeYoshi> i mean trump just destroyed that country..
[12:51:23] <JCAlcapone> but still, it has rivers of oil pouring out of soil
[12:51:31] <CayteaCrisis> I hate my own country for the simple fact it chose an asshole...that wants to build a fuckin' wall. Like China didn't try that already -_-.
[12:51:37] <JCAlcapone> it needs america to be free
[12:52:14] <SkyTech6> Destroying 3 factories... isn't really "destroying" the country
[12:52:15] <JCAlcapone> you dont have a choice, its all a plot
[12:52:27] <mamx29> All America president promiss lot of thing. But they never and the war they cause
[12:52:31] <JCAlcapone> you need to start to wake up, but ur media is all bought
[12:52:37] <CayteaCrisis> If it didn't work in China, it won't work between the US and Mexico.
[12:52:49] <PurpIeYoshi> Hes not gonna do shit
[12:53:08] <PurpIeYoshi> all the things he promise and didnt do
[12:53:16] <CayteaCrisis> Who'll build it? The people he's trying to keep out LUL
[12:53:33] <JCAlcapone> with mexico money also
[12:53:42] <PurpIeYoshi> the guy dont even believe in climat change somebody help him LUL
[12:54:11] <CayteaCrisis> Nah, Mexico recalled all their support and wish Americans weren't so stupid.
[12:54:36] <mamx29> But i still think Trump better then Hilary Clinton, she seem fake to me.
[12:54:44] <JCAlcapone> climat change is money making, weather is already mostly engeneerd
[12:55:01] <CayteaCrisis> He's never read a Science book, I don't even think he knows what NASA is doing xD LUL
[12:55:28] <PurpIeYoshi> Most likely, and Hilary was friend with Obama and i feel like he was WAY better than trump
[12:55:35] <uthgardthemediocre> i preict you will breath in the next 99 mins
[12:55:42] <PurpIeYoshi> yes he didnt do some of the things he said but still
[12:55:42] <Jeremycoolj> bro they shoed this same match yesterday wtf
