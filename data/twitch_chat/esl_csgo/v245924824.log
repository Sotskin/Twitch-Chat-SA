[13:05:12] <+miracleY0> ye
[13:05:36] <bluemario> mfray who won most recent major and how did sk do?
[13:06:08] <Saimscool> c9 won
[13:06:26] <bluemario> and sk?
[13:06:34] <Fedefar> Currygan
[13:06:36] <ryu_the_smasher> lost to c9 in semi's
[13:06:40] <Saimscool> c9 are looking...... very ehh atm
[13:06:47] <bluemario> sellout my point
[13:07:09] <ryu_the_smasher> C9 had a massive run
[13:07:31] <ryu_the_smasher> right after the major their performance dropped
[13:07:33] <Kricidile> probably the last 'massive run' for a while
[13:07:42] <Saimscool> ^
[13:07:48] <bluemario> yea... thats true
[13:07:50] <ryu_the_smasher> ^^
[13:07:59] <bluemario> they need shrood again
[13:08:13] <Saimscool> naaa
[13:08:16] <ryu_the_smasher> And there's also the fact that sk already had played 3 maps earlier that dat against Fnatic
[13:08:18] <Fedefar> Shrooooood
[13:08:25] <Saimscool> they need fresh teir 1 players
[13:08:41] <ryu_the_smasher> with all of those maps going nearly all the way
[13:08:43] <bluemario> second game same day is always worst
[13:08:48] <Saimscool> fnx is..... not the best they could have landed
[13:09:39] <ryu_the_smasher> @bluemario i say that that's one of the main reasons sk lost to c9. and that's coming from a c9 fan, not a butthurt sk fan.
[13:09:56] <bluemario> i agree mate
[13:10:28] <Galantaje> shroud playing cs? Kappa
[13:10:28] <bluemario> they game for 6-8 hours.. no one can keep concentration that long

[13:15:46] <ryu_the_smasher> wouldn't want to have you wait another 2 hours before you cold grab food
[13:16:13] <bluemario> well 12-12 youd expect the end of the game soon hehe
[13:16:28] <ryu_the_smasher> true
[13:17:08] <bluemario> you guys still play cs?
[13:17:14] <ryu_the_smasher> but then again 12-12 always gives a chance for overtime
[13:17:26] <bluemario> also true Kappa
[13:17:36] <ryu_the_smasher> I still play cs, training to get better at train (no pun intended)
[13:18:04] <bluemario> train is hard.. what rank are you?
[13:18:12] <ryu_the_smasher> S5
[13:18:14] <takeN2K> "different cloud 9"
[13:18:39] <ryu_the_smasher> I like to hold Ivy since silvers never check it and push B on t-side
[13:18:54] <bluemario> how many hours?
[13:19:04] <ryu_the_smasher> about 200
[13:19:17] <bluemario> train harder bro :)
[13:19:40] <weezyfin> :)
[13:19:48] <ryu_the_smasher> bad luck combined with alot of stupid mistakes keep me stuck in silver
[13:19:59] <bluemario> im mg2 also 200 ish
[13:20:07] <ryu_the_smasher> and terrible crosshair placement
[13:20:16] <bluemario> you soloq?
[13:20:24] <ryu_the_smasher> yes
[13:20:34] <ryu_the_smasher> i have only 1 irl friend who plays cs, and he's dmg
[13:20:47] <bluemario> ahh... that sucks
[13:20:52] <ryu_the_smasher> don't fancy dragging him and his team down when q'ing together
[13:21:05] <bluemario> i play with 1 friend and that helps a lot
[13:21:16] <bluemario> you got prime?
[13:21:21] <artem202020> 32-34?
[13:21:26] <ryu_the_smasher> yes
[13:21:46] <bluemario> only search for those ofc
[13:21:58] <iRay75> Why was Guardian playing with NaVi?
[13:21:59] <ryu_the_smasher> I sometimes do play with a friend from singapore who's gn3
[13:22:15] <ryu_the_smasher> but due to difference in timezones we can't play together that often
[13:22:33] <bluemario> there is no big difference from s1 to gn4
[13:22:46] <bluemario> you ll get it man :)
[13:22:59] <ryu_the_smasher> I do notice that i do terrible in gn3 matches while being pretty good in s5 matches
[13:23:08] <ryu_the_smasher> so there is a difference
[13:23:19] <bluemario> you watch youtube vids on cs?

[13:27:48] <bluemario> i playd 1 map only untill i learned placement and felt confident than moved on to another map

[13:29:09] <ryu_the_smasher> I played mirage alot, pretty much know the map apart from the smokes, and playing only train atm to improve there and have 2 maps i perform good on in my mappool

[13:30:56] <PairaDaBird> shrood :(
[13:30:58] <bluemario> warowl made some good smokes vids other wise watch stresmers or other youtube vids
[13:31:12] <ryu_the_smasher> I've watched nadeking as well
[13:31:20] <Juliusfranzen> Keepo
[13:31:23] <ryu_the_smasher> but i'm gonna check warowl's smoke videos
[13:31:39] <bluemario> the short smoke on mirage takes 3 sec to learn and is super usefull
[13:31:46] <+casualcarlos> I try to invent my own ones as much as possible lol
[13:31:49] <bluemario> from t
[13:31:50] <z4nku> WHAT is that play??
[13:31:51] <Juliusfranzen> Weed is Green
[13:32:02] <+casualcarlos> This makes it so that most players have hard times countering it
[13:32:05] <ryu_the_smasher> short from t apps entrance?
[13:32:24] <bluemario> no t spawn to short mid
[13:32:42] <bluemario> like t side window smoke
[13:33:01] <+casualcarlos> You should learn the connector smoke from T-spawn (close to apps there's a gate, go stand in the corner, aim in the bottom middle part of the red cloth and jump throw)
[13:33:40] <ryu_the_smasher> I'm practicing that smoke, but i keep getting the timing wrong and it hits the building
[13:33:44] <artem202020> 32-34?
[13:34:08] <ryu_the_smasher> yes
[13:34:20] <fora_> LOL
[13:34:22] <+casualcarlos> Then you're not aiming correctly. Aim in the middle of the cloth and go all the way to the bottom of it. (maybe make like a jumpbind - bind n +jump - for example
[13:34:23] <artem202020> Ty
[13:34:29] <+charlesreid89> is this live?
[13:34:34] <bluemario> you can smoke connector from app close to under too right
[13:34:35] <+casualcarlos> No
[13:34:44] <+charlesreid89> k thanks
[13:34:50] <+casualcarlos> It says rerun bro
[13:35:00] <ryu_the_smasher> i'm aiming with the nade practice map
[13:35:04] <+casualcarlos> If it says rerun then it means that it's not happening live.
[13:35:12] <+charlesreid89> k
[13:35:18] <+casualcarlos> np <3
[13:35:24] <Arbetsfornedringen> Is this not live?

[13:36:16] <+acidgod96> this is live from 2017!
[13:36:22] <coffeykiller> rerun is the sponsor
[13:36:24] <+charlesreid89> shroud is asleep he has a meeting with pubg ppl today
[13:36:31] <+acidgod96> lame
[13:36:36] <bluemario> carlos how good is le compaired to globals?
[13:36:43] <ryu_the_smasher> coffey, look at title, it says ESL One Cologne 2017
[13:36:49] <+casualcarlos> Well old ranking globals are now around LEM rank
[13:37:02] <+charlesreid89> i wish pubg would update like fornight does
[13:37:02] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[13:37:02] <+casualcarlos> So current globals are either Faceit LVL 9's or hackers
[13:37:14] <+casualcarlos> So really you can't compare...
[13:37:17] <ryu_the_smasher> or shroud
[13:37:32] <bluemario> i see. should i stop playing matchmaking?
[13:37:39] <Flostin_p> Gg
[13:37:42] <videx9> R.I.P SKA AND STEWIE press F to pay respect
[13:37:49] <coffeykiller> f
[13:37:50] <+casualcarlos> Just keep it at this: Current globals will wreck you. And unless you reach Le, don't quit matchmaking
[13:37:52] <iRay75> @casualcarlos is there again a wave of uncatchable cheaters in smfc/ge?
[13:38:01] <OriginsOfMe> @casualcarlos wasn't old rank global like top 6.5%? so it actually matched what dmg was before they got rid of the rank tracking sites
[13:38:06] <Flostin_p> IS THIS REALLY LIVE ??
[13:38:20] <+casualcarlos> But I got to go, have a good day guys! @iRay75 Not sure, but there's plenty of cheats that are undetectable with the current version of VAC
[13:38:28] <videx9> NO, ITS A RERUN
[13:38:29] <bluemario> 🤔🤔🤔 interesting
[13:38:51] <ryu_the_smasher> VAC doesn't work anyway
[13:38:54] <+acidgod96> IT SAYS 2017 in upper rite corner BabyRage
[13:38:58] <iRay75> @casualcarlos cy@
[13:39:04] <+casualcarlos> @OriginsOfMe Well, old globals because of the new ranking system got deranked-ish and now they're around LE-LEM. Real globals are way better
