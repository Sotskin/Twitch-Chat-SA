[0:37:45] <+Clivefrog> pro sports are always split male/female

[2:56:53] <MrSarcasm> I'm new to this, but I always thought gaming was non gender specific i.e. men could compete against women because there isn't a competitive difference between genders?

[2:58:04] <miss_invictus> I think it would be more comfortable playing in a team with all the same gender

[2:58:31] <$spaceyourfacee> The day a woman comes out with the skill to compete at the very top, guaranteed a team will pick her up, but it just hasnt happened yet

[4:42:33] <+cz0r> @slypacifier white knights do it for the attention of the women lol
[4:42:45] <CorbinJS19> Seriously tho is anyone else having lag issues?
[4:42:51] <+smileyface4295> no
[4:42:53] <+PoMoTV> supreme (lost ge cuz didnt play a month), le acc
[4:42:56] <+LittleChico> no lag here
[4:42:57] <Eileen_AU> fk my arm hurts
[4:43:03] <POiNtLEsSEFF0RT> They should make a seperate ad break for women’s league
[4:43:04] <+Dubsys> I'd understand having a separate womens league if they were garbage because they were genetically inferior but they're not they're just worse at the game
[4:43:12] <Taryn> @pyromaniac_1010 No the majority of mature people who have a gf/wife respect their gf/wife and other woman.
[4:43:19] <slypacifier> @cz0r 'a person or thing that comes to someone's aid.' thats a white knight
[4:43:25] <CaveHorrorrs> @TarynTragedyyxo No problem, its irritating lol, I love twitch but a lot of the people on here are socially deprived and it just makes things ridiculous lmao
[4:43:40] <maddutv> what is this music
[4:43:46] <ambestgame> omg its so nice here
[4:43:48] <+BobbyBoucherJr> im not waiting 4mins
[4:43:54] <TecoLive> Why is there a separeted women's league? Why can't they just play with guys?
[4:43:55] <+cz0r> @cz0r maybe 10 years ago it would've been, the meaning has long since changed
[4:43:58] <ambestgame> no spamming chat
[4:44:02] <+PoMoTV> @CEMx_TV yours?
[4:44:02] <+CEMx_TV> i feel bad for female cs. the hate they get is so fucked up.
[4:44:05] <+LittleChico> Majority of ppl in chat saying "female CS LUL" are kids, so don't bother
[4:44:06] <kitlah_> @maddutv calming music
[4:44:09] <ambestgame> so nice
[4:44:12] <+CEMx_TV> @PoMoTV mg lol
[4:44:19] <maddutv> i should be sleeping! work in 5 hours
[4:44:20] <CaveHorrorrs> @Trklive Probably because of all the hate
[4:44:23] <Taryn> @cavehorrorrs I've noticed that CSGO Twitch community has always had a very toxic following. May because of a lot of younger viewers or something. Not too sure.
[4:44:25] <+PoMoTV> @CEMx_TV where from?
[4:44:34] <+CEMx_TV> @PoMoTV canada
[4:44:39] <Laskov36> Female cs LUL
[4:44:45] <rubenmiguel97> homie have to see this
[4:44:47] <rebelrob73> A nice guy/ white knight is someone who will defend women when they dont need it to try and get the girls to like them
[4:44:47] <@Moobot> Join the ESLCS steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/eslcs
[4:44:49] <+LittleChico> SourPls
[4:44:58] <+cz0r> @rebelrob73 exactly
[4:45:02] <+Dubsys> when even the casters need to make excuses for them not being able to hit shots LUL
[4:45:08] <+PoMoTV> No because twitch has a shit ton of trolls, especially on cs @TarynTragedyyxo
[4:45:19] <POiNtLEsSEFF0RT> @cemx_tv me too and it’s all from little 13-27 year old males who can’t stand being beaten in video games by women.
[4:45:28] <theclassyfenn> I wish they were given chance to play with the men
[4:45:32] <slypacifier> @rebelrob73 'a person or thing that comes to someone's aid.' its literally the definition lmao
[4:45:33] <taxevasion101> making me proper annoyed
[4:45:35] <kittehsparkles> everytime grls play someone explains what "white knighting" is. lol
[4:45:41] <Taryn> @pomotv Yeah and for the most part trolls our usually a younger audience who aren't fully matured.
[4:45:44] <+CEMx_TV> @POiNtLEsSEFF0RT so true
[4:45:45] <+Dubsys> @theclassyfenn there's nothing stopping them, they can enter the regular ladders as well.
[4:45:46] <Laskov36> what did I join here lol
[4:45:51] <Zyzzchestbrah> Female CS LUL why does there have to be a female league LUL when there's no physical aspect to esports LUL
[4:45:55] <+BobbyBoucherJr> it's only the males that are between 12 and 50
[4:46:01] <rebelrob73> @POiNtLEsSEFF0RT Its tru I got killed by a girl one time and I killed myself
[4:46:02] <POiNtLEsSEFF0RT> @cemx_tv just saying
[4:46:13] <CaveHorrorrs> @rebelrob73 Imagine being so socially inept that you classify anyone that has at least somewhat of a grasp of the real world as either normies or white knights haHAA
[4:46:21] <Laskov36> @rebelrob73 would have done the same
[4:46:30] <+Tragicck> women's
[4:46:37] <+PoMoTV> It's true that girls should be able to qualify for the same tournaments and big events as proffesional male teams but let's be honest, you really think a female team will win from any of the world leaders?
[4:46:49] <POiNtLEsSEFF0RT> @rebelrob73 sounds like that could be true i got beaten by my mom in a video game once i was ashamed of myself
[4:46:52] <rebelrob73> @CaveHorrorrs Yeah that would suck
[4:47:00] <+Dubsys> PoMoTV they could if they put in the time and effort that their male counterparts do but it's incredibly obvious that they don't
[4:47:02] <+LittleChico> Twitch chat in charge of deciding how anything should be LUL
[4:47:27] <liraneon> but even though if they can't beat the best, they sure can beat many other male teams
[4:47:28] <CaveHorrorrs> @cz0r I never said anything about seperate gender leagues lmao
[4:47:32] <+christheaverage> Hey guys, i like to talk to you about joining centrelink esports for a upcoming qualifier
[4:47:33] <Zyzzchestbrah> @PoMoTV They want equality so they got their own league? Thats the opposite of equality OMEGALUL
[4:47:39] <POiNtLEsSEFF0RT> 1 minute guys(/girls!)
[4:47:43] <CaveHorrorrs> @cz0r You're the one sitting on here talking about gender when it shouldn't even be an issue
[4:47:49] <rebelrob73> @POiNtLEsSEFF0RT Getting beaten at a game by your mom and some random girl on the internet is totally different. Getting beaten by your mom is totally embarrasing
[4:47:50] <Zyzzchestbrah> @christheaverage XD
[4:48:00] <VeLocity1g> In twitch chat anyone that has any kind of respect for anyone gets called a white knight. It has no real meaning. it's just a used as a basic response to anyone
[4:48:00] <Taryn> @cavehorrorrs I use to be a little keyboard warrior when I was 13-14. However, I matured, got engaged and got my own place. I hope one day that people will be able to do the same.
[4:48:04] <NeoSanityTV> > Everyone has an opinion on a topic> Every does not have qualified knowledge of a topic
[4:48:12] <POiNtLEsSEFF0RT> @rebelrob73 well...
[4:48:25] <Laskov36> !time
[4:48:27] <thariky_brasil> que horas inicia?
[4:48:40] <thariky_brasil> !time
[4:48:47] <+Dubsys> It's also partially that the good female players are dragged down by having to play with 3-4 other awful women and it makes them look bad not wanting proper teams working to be the best to consider them
[4:49:27] <slypacifier> the guys who bag female CS are the same ones that harass them in game LUL
[4:49:33] <+A1ec_0> Why do they have a woman’s league
[4:49:39] <+Dubsys> bullyhunters also wasn't scripted :^)
[4:49:39] <pyromaniac_1010> i'd love to see some of the top tier women get a chance in the some of the male dominated teams.

[4:49:42] <Taryn> @cz0r I'm not talking shit to anymore. I'm having a mature conversation with another adult. That's not a keyboard warrior.
[4:49:43] <Zyzzchestbrah> @bigggameplays Yeah and they're still shit. There should be no womens league more tournaments and let them compete with the men
[4:49:47] <Tyrnhoz> noot noot?... Great name LUL
[4:49:54] <+KeoniColbert> @slypacifier What do you mean by "Bag"
[4:50:06] <+Dubsys> pyromaniac_1010 it happens all the time, they get trashed and it's a funny meme for about a week
[4:50:10] <toksenkk> Men broadcasters >.>
[4:50:15] <POiNtLEsSEFF0RT> Are any of these women also IRL streamers LUL
[4:50:16] <Calnus01> @KeoniColbert bag = insult
[4:50:24] <rebelrob73> Male casters LUL
[4:50:28] <+KeoniColbert> ahh ok
[4:50:31] <Laskov36> male commentators?! HotPokket HotPokket HotPokket
[4:50:34] <pyromaniac_1010> @Dubsys yeah nah
[4:50:41] <Taryn> @pointlesseff0rt I'm guessing some of them or lots of them stream CS!
[4:50:44] <slypacifier> @KeoniColbert criticising someone. Australian slang
[4:50:50] <+Dubsys> it's literally happened twice this year with female vs male exhibition matches
[4:50:55] <Zyzzchestbrah> @POiNtLEsSEFF0RT No but ofc they all have streams
[4:50:59] <+LittleChico> I like how there are only men arguing and girls just give up on chat LUL
[4:51:03] <+Dubsys> don't you remember watching that match where the women naded themselves
[4:51:10] <+Shulltz> lol this chat is sad to read, just watch the games mate
[4:51:14] <inoobyy> hey i am looking for a gf :( :(
[4:51:24] <+KeoniColbert> @slypacifier ok lol where im from that means hooking up with
[4:51:26] <pyromaniac_1010> exhibition matches aren't shit man
[4:51:28] <+cheating> I agree with shulltz tbf
[4:51:28] <callmelies> Women suck at this game though compared to males
[4:51:28] <@Cent> I wish people would pay more attention to the match and not the fact Women are playing FailFish
[4:51:29] <toksenkk> Thaats creepy
[4:51:31] <rebelrob73> @Dubsys not a good example when 1G is a meme LUL
[4:51:39] <+KeoniColbert> @Shulltz There's no game too watch yet
[4:51:46] <CaveHorrorrs> @TarynTragedyyxo yeah I hope so too, there are a lot of people on here who have little to no grasp on reality, once they get jobs and get out in the real world their viewpoints should change

[4:55:39] <Zyzzchestbrah> like its so hard to get your friends to play the game because OFC they have to pay for ESEA or set up faceit takes wayy too long instead of the booming old 2015 cs where you could just lobby up and smash MM with barely any cheaters
[4:55:42] <+WhispeR1> did I miss anything
[4:55:42] <buhtterstick> not everyone deserves respect

[5:21:53] <MrMaffen> I really don't get why female cs players are worse than male ones. There shouldn't be any physical disadvantages like in irl sports. is it just the fact that so few girls in general play cs?

[5:32:01] <jooordyn> i know, shes disgraced us
[5:32:21] <+Max_Unix> I got banned from this chat earlier was pretty funny
[5:32:30] <littlebigboned> @cent Alright, @examinations 's explanation seemed legit to me. This should not be a new issue. They probably dealt with this in olympics and other major events. There is no shame in discussing. Im not trying to disrespect anyone.
[5:32:33] <DiinkyNZ> nah nah, we all friends now jordyn its ok
[5:32:34] <@Cent> If anyone has issues with how this is being managed, my Whispers are open. But with how much abuse the topic has gathered, please pay more attention to the Match rather than the fact that the people playing are Women.
[5:33:00] <+Max_Unix> It's the fact they need their own exclusive women only tournaments to be competitive.
[5:33:08] <CoralReefKeef> sarinaREE
[5:33:10] <+meechythree> @littlebigboned BigBrother is watching
[5:33:21] <Matttyy> they're kinda bots
[5:33:22] <jooordyn> i cannot talk to you anymore @DiinkyNZ
[5:33:25] <@Cent> No I'm only asking simply because it's very hard to tell between serious inquiries and people trying to be jerks. @littlebigboned
[5:33:33] <VeLocity1g> the hate is always really dumb. you can get on MM/esea/faceit and see tons of guys that play a lot worse.
[5:33:36] <DiinkyNZ> wow cara blocked nat into that fight, arguments are happening in ts guys i repeat, arguments are happening
[5:33:41] <+solahhh_> crazy how the gender of the people playing causes so much drama, can't people just watch without being sexist?

[5:35:36] <snehz> voice checks when? throughout the game?
[5:35:41] <+Max_Unix> The problem I have with this is that there is nothing to stop there female teams entering mainstream qualifiers with male teams, but they are too shit to qualify and have their own lowkey strictly female team only tournaments.,
[5:35:43] <+HolgerDK> @littlebigboned LOL, what a spring chicken you are then :D

[5:39:15] <candr_dk> @segshane there are way fewer women playing video games -> way fewer pros -> average skill level way lower. its the same in chess

[5:41:31] <+Max_Unix> @VeLocity1g it's the fact that in the normal esl_csgo games the chat is complete cancer literally insulting every player for anything, but coming here and insulting female counterstrike isn't allowed. That's what humours me.
