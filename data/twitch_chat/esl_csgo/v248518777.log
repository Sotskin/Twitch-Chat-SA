[17:50:18] <+TriHardNickQer> @slipndip Not sure they are usually pretty strict
[17:50:35] <MatthewGamble> his account is suspended right now I think, yeah. I'm not sure what that means for him appearing on stream at events.
[17:50:36] <+TriHardNickQer> I think they are allowed to as long as you can't actually see them
[17:51:07] <slipndip> if he is completety banned then LUL
