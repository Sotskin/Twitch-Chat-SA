[6:28:25] <matheus_slx> : someone know whats the viewmodel,crosshair and resolution of this stream?
[6:31:19] <mr_abssy> I believe that you can find crosshair on crosshair map that you can custom make or even chose one of the teams crosshairs, im not sure but i think that there is alot of crosshairs like this one there
[6:32:06] <Davis3450> im just seeing this with the shittiest school internet
[6:32:26] <mr_abssy> its laggy for me too
[6:32:38] <Davis3450> ya, kinda
[6:33:02] <mr_abssy> like second ago, lagged for a two seconds
[6:33:36] <mr_abssy> its not you, myb, sometimes twitch got stream laggs i think
[6:34:02] <ramakins89> no lag here
[6:34:10] <Davis3450> actually its kinda laggy, i just put it in 60 fps but due to the internet im just seeing like 15
[6:34:42] <Davis3450> damn awwsome shot
[6:35:21] <matheus_slx> mr_abssy i know about this map, but i really like how this ESL crosshair looks like
