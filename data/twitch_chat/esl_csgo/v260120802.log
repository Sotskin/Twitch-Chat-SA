[3:21:24] <kyle621> Jame tier 3 online awper LUL
[3:21:35] <+Fox1Up> weird, he usually uses the g403
[3:21:49] <+thime_dw> a wireless mouse?
[3:21:55] <+Fox1Up> mhm
[3:22:00] <+thime_dw> ew
[3:22:10] <+Fox1Up> weird choice though isn't it, usually pros want less input lag and go with a corded mouse
[3:22:25] <+dob_> Nifty doesnt have a white mouse
[3:22:25] <+thime_dw> he is a old cod console player
[3:22:41] <DecadeUK> are the seriously wearing h4x pins? that's hilarious
[3:22:44] <+Fox1Up> what does console playing have to do with it haha
[3:22:47] <+dob_> You mean JKS?
[3:23:18] <+dob_> what is wrong with playing with a wireless mouse?
[3:23:25] <+Fox1Up> jks has a white one, thats who i saw
[3:23:44] <+Fox1Up> and uh, playing with a wireless mouse means you have slightly more input lag due to the non-wired connection

[5:49:11] <Heydobe> why is that game dying
[5:49:36] <Heydobe> its not as popular as it used to be
[5:49:40] <+nihaark> @Heydobe cuz Battle Royale games are becoming prominent
[5:50:20] <duyquoctran> Cause everybody is playing fortnite and pubg now
[5:50:31] <duyquoctran> Even MOBA games are dying
[5:50:44] <Heydobe> im stll playing cs 1.6 lol
[5:51:13] <duyquoctran> Lmao the most recently time i play 1.6 was 5 yrs ago
[5:53:03] <+nihaark> I play GO often and still prefer it over PUBG but ive been spending more and more time on Pubg and fortnite
[5:54:16] <basicgear1997> Eh BR are starting to die
[5:54:40] <basicgear1997> Pubg just got a boost with the new update tho
[5:54:55] <duyquoctran> Not in a near future bro
[5:55:31] <NicholasPetter> idk, i like BR modes, they are fun
[5:57:26] <SrJuniior> taco na sk ?
