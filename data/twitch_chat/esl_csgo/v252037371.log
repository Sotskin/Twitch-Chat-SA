[1:43:21] <spaghety0> wait, is that the real @whiteguurlwasted?
[1:43:37] <+flapjack456> Why can't female teams compete with male teams? Anyone know why?
[1:43:37] <@Moobot> Start your esports career on ESL Play: http://esl.gg/eslplaycsgo
[1:43:44] <spaghety0> I knew it from a mile away
[1:43:54] <+kokainsniffarn> they do compete with men
[1:44:11] <Primnix> dash is wallin
[1:44:13] <Sanson155> what rank they are?
[1:44:16] <hit585> @flapjack456 they do but they get wiped
[1:44:19] <+kokainsniffarn> but they mostly end up at last place sadly
[1:44:23] <spaghety0> @flapjack456 because women don't play fps games as much as men
[1:44:24] <Teckerke> flapjack456 there was a reason but i forgot it
[1:44:36] <spaghety0> not being sexist
[1:44:36] <bassyboy> inferior
[1:44:44] <sscsgo1> nice flick
[1:44:46] <spaghety0> just saying, in general...
[1:44:48] <+flapjack456> @spaghety0 then why do they want equal pay if they are nowhere near as good?
[1:44:58] <abes> jfoxHey jfoxWhip jfoxBoys
[1:44:58] <bassyboy> you tell em flapjack456
[1:45:01] <+gianni0241> Facepalm so bad

[1:46:12] <Primnix> hnm
[1:46:13] <Minifeatures1717> This game is very unequal for the male counter part females have larger access to prizepools and its not fair on the men
[1:46:19] <spaghety0> they don't think its because they're bad
[1:46:21] <whiteguurlwasted> like 1

[1:52:47] <nanssss> who the youngest player in this match @whiteguurlwasted
[1:52:48] <ariba> Implying 60 ping makes a difference 8)
[1:52:50] <bassyboy> this whole thing is a simulation
[1:52:52] <hit585> @flapjack456 ikr maybe u should change ur gender and compete in female cs Kappa
[1:52:55] <safwansakib> stalker
[1:53:04] <Mosski22> @ariba it does lol
[1:53:05] <whiteguurlwasted> treena i think @nanssss
[1:53:09] <+christheaverage> well look @KomodoAU , it's your job to see that she survives ok?
[1:53:13] <ariba> It absolutely does not, Mosski22.
[1:53:17] <bassyboy> can i identify as binary
[1:53:23] <nanssss> rip treena u will be missed
[1:53:24] <whiteguurlwasted> no bass
[1:53:30] <Mosski22> @ariba So no difference between 5 ping and 60?
[1:53:33] <KomodoAU> roger that, but kt and pixel will be with us....
[1:53:37] <+flapjack456> @ariba 60 ping makes a massive difference?
[1:53:38] <Primnix> @bassyboy binary csgo comps will come out eventually
[1:53:38] <bassyboy> why not
[1:53:50] <ariba> Let alone making a difference in a matchmaking game like the one we're currently watching. It's literally irrelevant unless your ping is 90+.
[1:53:58] <jimNeso> Keepo
[1:54:01] <+flapjack456> @ariba not true
[1:54:02] <+christheaverage> oh, well all i can say is gl and don't get injured

[3:04:46] <jugiman> why dont these females play in the same group as men do?
[3:04:49] <entz> lakers can i rub your head at iem
[3:04:59] <NatarshaAU> why u get paid more @jugiman

[3:05:26] <sarina> when is ur team playing @Zimples_
[3:05:26] <13______> @NatarshaAU what? that makes zero sense? LuL
[3:05:28] <+Max_Unix> Why can't male teams compete in a female only tournament.
[3:05:30] <KomodoAU> @entz at IEM :O
[3:05:31] <Zimples_> some of them have crosshair placement at toes
[3:05:34] <+Newyyyy> @jugiman watch out i asked that question yesterday and nearly got kicked out of the chat
[3:05:35] <TheRealSkythe> Are these Australian teams only? Or what?
[3:05:41] <Textacs> @NatarshaAU look at the viewers that explains everything
[3:05:44] <MrFraggy> @jugiman technically, nothing stops female teams to play in the same leagues as men
[3:05:45] <JamieAU> nice insult sarina i dont think he's a female
[3:05:45] <willow_> @KomodoAU HI
[3:05:48] <entz> @KomodoAU ill rub your head as well if youd like
[3:05:50] <KomodoAU> hi mum @sarina sarinaL
[3:05:52] <raebaes> what a boring match
[3:05:53] <+Max_Unix> forsenOMEGA
[3:05:54] <sarina> my mistake u right @JamieAU
[3:06:00] <NatarshaAU> who asked you @Textacs
[3:06:09] <KomodoAU> @entz ooooo fancy, i likey
[3:06:14] <nanssss> streamroll*
[3:06:18] <jugiman> @natarshaau well cause i earn more. not about gender. men have zero competetive edge in Counter-Strike, so why are the genders separated?
[3:06:19] <whiteguurlwasted> @Textacs we get it you play cs..
[3:06:23] <KomodoAU> @willow_ hellooooo
[3:06:24] <Zimples_> wdym? if I was female Id be playing rn @sarina
[3:06:31] <flickz12> does the winner of this qual?
[3:06:34] <Zimples_> going 30-0 omg
[3:06:36] <13______> Nothing says that females can not play on the same tournaments as men. You just do not want to because the top female team would be tier 3 max.
[3:06:36] <gamingmonsta> How has dash not died?

[3:18:02] <+Max_Unix> @zennnnnx3 it's not even a mens division. it's just a regular division.
[3:18:05] <david50301> I guess the female only tournaments is to give women more recognition from sponsors and make cs more attractive to pursue as a job. Just a wild guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[3:18:06] <TheRealSkythe> It's awesome girls have their own league and it's probably the best solution for everyone.
[3:18:06] <S0UL_NINJA> @zennnnnx3 well said

[3:36:30] <raebaes> reaction shot on drally @jimneso
[3:36:34] <@Cent> Bleh. This isn't the place to have this conversation. If you want to debate Reaction times and the Female Event existing. You can email ESL. @jaksary Just drop the subject.
[3:36:37] <mfwsh> hi !
[3:36:38] <JamieAU> i said lil suzi were just tac lossing rounds to give them hope just to destroy their morale
[3:36:46] <david50301> The gaming scene need more female interest in general, it's is a pretty big demografic = 💲💲💲
[3:36:58] <jimNeso> they just don't understand @raebaes
[3:37:06] <+Max_Unix> @LenkaaaXd can you elaborate on your "needs".
[3:37:16] <Jaksary> @Cent didn't want to go full on, some1 askd why they compete seperately, and I told him how it is.
[3:37:36] <Bennny_K> Any1 here have a spare 980ti or better gpu for me? add me on steam; mouthwash
[3:37:42] <NatarshaAU> graphHAND
[3:37:44] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> because the female scene just aren't as good as the male screen

[3:37:56] <hatzau> COME BACK LETS GO
[3:37:59] <Halted> lil suzi needs to live up to their name and mac rush one of these OT rounds
[3:38:08] <TheRealSkythe> @david50301 you'll probably have to pay them to watch and play CS
[3:38:12] <Bennny_K> Nah not rlly tbh :/ @Chemical___
[3:38:16] <Halted> if not i'mma be disappointed
[3:38:20] <Moqqah> must have a good coach @hatzau
[3:38:24] <@Cent> That's fine. Just drop it. People are here to watch and support friends, not debate. If you really want to debate someone just take it to whispers. I don't want to read it and I'm sure people in chat don't either. @jaksary
[3:38:24] <Chemical___> Bennny_K damn what am i gonna do with my gpus now
[3:38:32] <+CardinalKnight> thats fair @Halted
[3:38:50] <LenkaaaXd> Because male scene has years advanced as a pro scene. Most female teams are still semi-pro.
[3:38:53] <Bennny_K> flip em
[3:39:02] <acefighter92> How’s this not sexist
[3:39:14] <+zennnnnx3> lol its insane that people have to pretend that each gender doesnt have unique advantages/disadvantages
[3:39:26] <Jaksary> the whole world is crazy, welcome to 2018
[3:39:28] <+zennnnnx3> in order to not hurt someone's feelings
[3:39:46] <JamieAU> this is what peak performance looks like @WeAreNuKeClan
[3:39:48] <Peace_Duster> If women are equal to men, why do they have their separate CSGO leagues?
[3:39:56] <mfwsh> @joinkz @bennny_k hi felas

[3:40:13] <+TlMBERS> girl brains
[3:40:14] <+mmmaiamm_akademon> I'm going to be honest ive never seen a female pro be better than most male pros it's just how it is

[3:40:15] <mfwsh> thanks guys
[3:40:24] <LenkaaaXd> Jaksary: it's a biological fact that girls have slower reaction times than boys
[3:40:24] <+Max_Unix> this chat is making my day
