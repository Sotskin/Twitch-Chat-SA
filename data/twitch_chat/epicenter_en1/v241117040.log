[4:20:17] <Rockspecht> FrankerZ
[4:20:44] <+hagg1> the naix lastpick is such a mystery
[4:20:56] <+hagg1> why not pick a carry that can deal with lycan

[4:22:23] <snugglepuff1> :)
[4:22:29] <ZEEPHYR123> oh tiny laging
[4:22:41] <+hagg1> its not easy obviously since you cant rly pick an agi core vs ET
[4:22:48] <+hagg1> but naix is just meh
[4:23:30] <8ackwoods> jug could work maybe morph
[4:23:45] <yordan10xx> mafia call
[4:23:52] <+hagg1> the problem with morph is you rely so heavily on the agi for armour
[4:23:57] <+hagg1> and thats all removed by ET
[4:24:02] <MrFubar> bloodseeker ftw
[4:24:06] <+hagg1> so you just kinda instadie if ET gets close
[4:24:39] <8ackwoods> morph 1 shots et though
[4:25:51] <+hagg1> ye its not unplayable, would just have to be super careful

[5:34:06] <ZEEPHYR123> why vgj pick like this?
[5:34:06] <@Moobot> Mad Enough? bit.ly/epicmad
[5:34:35] <vbcxzthuzi5> they are trying to change their style in lane
[5:34:57] <dylan_morra> well this game is definitely in the bag of LGD
[5:34:57] <ZEEPHYR123> i mean for what reason?
[5:34:58] <lelouchkiseki> i might work
[5:35:03] <vbcxzthuzi5> bc they always get rekt by other strong teams in 10-20min
[5:35:30] <ZEEPHYR123> but their old start defeating lgd 2 in a row recent match
[5:35:38] <ZEEPHYR123> btw ty for the info
[5:35:52] <vbcxzthuzi5> you can search rotk in weibo
[5:36:04] <dylan_morra> they constantly losing their lane before 20 mins, they only win by comeback late game
[5:36:05] <LuckNut> what a mess
[5:36:18] <vbcxzthuzi5> yes
[5:36:36] <vbcxzthuzi5> so they want to do sth to improve
[5:36:39] <dylan_morra> like the game with newbee recently, 2 - 0 just by comeback, they lost the laning phase totally.
[5:36:57] <LuckNut> Newbee are good at stalling though
[5:37:21] <vbcxzthuzi5> EZ comeback against CN team
[5:37:21] <ZEEPHYR123> oh i see now why
[5:37:45] <vbcxzthuzi5> but VP and EG never give you the chance
[5:38:26] <yordan10xx> kamma>frezee
[5:38:34] <yordan10xx> need change name again
[5:38:40] <dylan_morra> even though jakiro is good laning hero, they still couldnt totally win top lane as u see even with SK help against only tiny and WD.
[5:39:24] <hoangdat12> Who win f10k guys ?????
[5:39:24] <@Moobot> Be positive, chat :)

[5:40:21] <dylan_morra> nah its actually ame style is play farming hero. He just didnt expect 4 members of VGJ are there.Ame is a great player
[5:40:22] <vbcxzthuzi5> mid game
[5:41:21] <dylan_morra> Ame is the fastest farm player I have ever seen.
[5:41:48] <vbcxzthuzi5> lol
[5:42:24] <dylan_morra> u just cant farm with tiny, but PL, MK, Jugg, gyro,... I mean every single hero in his hand is insanely farm
[5:42:38] <vbcxzthuzi5> yes
[5:42:40] <maulfansclub> they throwing WutFace
[5:43:21] <+conghieu221100> they throwing NotLikeThis
[5:43:33] <aceking198> VGJ are just good at team fighting if you don't play fast enough vgj just reaches the point they can 5 man team fight and win
[5:43:36] <vbcxzthuzi5> they are weak in mid game,but strong in later game
[5:43:40] <ilovekung> see ,only 25 min ,where r u now herald dylan :))))))
