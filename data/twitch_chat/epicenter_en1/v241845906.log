[0:53:27] <+jsimmons407> @BkopCasting if the ult debuff was gone then he cant be denied
[0:53:48] <Furby_King> @BkopCasting yep dota wiki confirms was possible
[0:53:57] <+Gingyman36> He couldn't have been denied. Only Gale is deniable from Veno and it wasn't on him at the time.

[0:55:58] <Furby_King> @jsimmons407 oh i see, so poison sting (without gale) and veno ult take priority? and in general u can have an effect on u?
[0:56:02] <Glinkerton> am i still ban
[0:56:08] <@BkopCasting> no
[0:56:13] <Glinkerton> jesus never know which channel bans for what
[0:56:16] <Furby_King> cant*
[0:56:17] <+jsimmons407> no i meant gale
[0:56:20] <+jsimmons407> not ult
[0:56:31] <+jsimmons407> poison sting isnt deniable, gale is
[0:56:55] <+jsimmons407> gale had worn off just before he went to deny i think
[0:56:58] <Furby_King> @jsimmons407 right, but in general, any other hurting buff on the hero stops a deny yes?
[0:57:08] <Glinkerton> i wanted to say that too but i was muted BibleThump my moment to shine

[3:08:40] <Nickapow> I mean, VG.J I think have a better chance
[3:08:44] <Philliphus> @Nickapow VGJ are favorites, but they just played 3 games in a row, i suppose LGD will take it
[3:08:45] <Nickapow> @Philliphus okay
[3:09:26] <Nickapow> yeah but they got like 40-ish minutes to kinda cool down

[3:12:29] <a7maxd> does anyone know when is team secret vs liquid?
[3:12:30] <Philliphus> just put on the underdog if you wanna bet, its closer to 50 50, use value bet if you are bettig
[3:12:44] <QU3EU> in regards to vgj vs lgd
[3:13:33] <jzzjyodj43> LGD is really bad now
[3:13:52] <Noctis_L7> They just 2-0d VG
[3:14:00] <QU3EU> 9hrs till team secret and liquid
[3:14:06] <QU3EU> australia
[3:14:24] <Philliphus> LGD is fresh and VGJ played 3 games in a row, with less then 15 min break..
[3:14:37] <jzzjyodj43> VG is really bad now
[3:15:04] <malcoholica> VGJT has been looking solid though, until they match up against the big dogs
[3:15:05] <@Moobot> Mad Enough? bit.ly/epicmad
[3:15:07] <malcoholica> LGD is not one of them
[3:15:08] <a7maxd> thank you
[3:15:33] <soloque> lgd not a big dog
[3:15:35] <soloque> ok
[3:15:44] <malcoholica> I bet J Lins been hyped about his team recently bcecause theyve growth so much
[3:16:06] <Philliphus> well vgj is currently "top 1 china team" according to statistics atm
[3:16:12] <malcoholica> whens the last time LGD has been relevant? A year is a very long time in dota terms
[3:16:22] <+yakri> yeah VGJ looks really good until they match up against a team that will likely be at TI and then they get stomped 2-0 like they're 2k pubs.
[3:16:38] <+yakri> The difference is almost comically massive, you would think it would be more even.
[3:16:53] <Umseslad> virtus pro is without a doubt the best team in the world right now
[3:17:12] <Nickapow> @Philliphus so you suggest I should value bet on the lgd? xD
[3:17:23] <soloque> the best team now is obviously og
[3:17:23] <Umseslad> No shame in losing to them, even if they could have put up a bigger fight
[3:17:32] <jzzjyodj43> this is ez for VGT
[3:17:34] <soloque> since miracles there now
[3:17:34] <@Moobot> Our social media: http://epicenter.gg/ | http://facebook.com/epicentergg | https://twitter.com/epicentergg
[3:17:36] <ambackguys> @Umseslad I think VP are, but not favourites for TI since they can always throw
[3:17:53] <Philliphus> @Nickapow yes, value bat on lgd
[3:17:59] <malcoholica> But look at newbee vs secret. NB clearly have the talent but they've gotten beat up so hard by secret yesterday. Sometimes they just have bad days
[3:18:05] <ambackguys> @soloque dont make fun of them, they just need a good mid. I've heard Cancel will join them soon, so their TI hopes should be back Kappa
[3:18:17] <sarotube> 2:53
[3:18:36] <soloque> who ?
[3:18:42] <soloque> i wasnt making fun
[3:18:46] <+yakri> @Umseslad Yeah but VGJ hasn't done well vs other tier 1 teams either. There's no doubt in my mind they never should have had the chance to play VP in that final. It was just the format that screwed things up
[3:20:00] <+mcporkrhymez> we already know it wont start in a min Kappa
[3:20:32] <PICKLESIEMER> B-GOD TERRITORY NOW

[3:27:30] <malcoholica> @yakri they time where they earned 700k in the past year. They arent a joke team by any stretch. They just haven't been good enough to play the T1 teams ever, but with more experience they will be a serious contender

[3:28:58] <+yakri> @malcoholica Oh sure, like I said a while back, they look really good whenever they aren't playing against the tier 1 teams. They just have a ways to go if they want to get more than fluke wins vs those top tier teams.
[3:29:02] <lovecito2017> but i put 170 $ on LGD

[3:29:53] <Laki82> You could use VPgame
[3:29:56] <lovecito2017> en ***
[3:30:02] <Philliphus> best pages to bet are regular sports pages who got into Esports. you just bet live after draft xD

[3:30:38] <@Moobot> Be positive, chat :)
[3:30:38] <Nickapow> @Philliphus ahhah it's the best when you can bet after they've drafted xD
[3:30:49] <malcoholica> @yakri Agreed. They have one hell of a roster though and have the potential to go big. If they can learn well from the losses vs the T1 guys, they are a serious contender for this TI, being a China year to win and all
[3:30:52] <quinkerros> @philliphus ANY NAME? PogChamp
[3:30:53] <PICKLESIEMER> fy 4Head
[3:30:58] <lovecito2017> i trust in lgd style
[3:31:00] <Sk1iLL_> :)
[3:31:06] <lovecito2017> they made me rich too many times
[3:31:19] <ocean1820> I say secret make it to the finals this year in Ti
[3:31:27] <Laki82> This meta is anti-chinese however
[3:31:28] <lovecito2017> like today vs vici gaming .. i won 95$
[3:31:45] <Laki82> and I feel like VG.J thanks to a lot of good showings against CIS teams
[3:31:52] <Laki82> Adapted to more aggresive playstyle
[3:32:05] <Laki82> Although I would not see naga as more aggresive
[3:32:08] <Laki82> Kappa
[3:32:09] <ocean1820> VP LIQUID AND SECRET run over Chinese teams man
[3:32:13] <lovecito2017> watch that draf haha
[3:32:24] <Laki82> They do, but LGD is a chinese team
[3:32:27] <Laki82> What's your point
[3:32:36] <Laki82> They are not playing VP
[3:32:41] <Laki82> They are playing LGD
[3:32:56] <ocean1820> My point is that Europe will own Ti this year
[3:32:57] <Laki82> You can get stomped
[3:33:00] <LawdJaraxxus> fy is a player if i recall
[3:33:02] <Laki82> And still get something out of it
[3:33:02] <PICKLESIEMER> cmonBruh
[3:33:03] <yellingsjtu> is lgd sponsored by vp?
[3:33:11] <yellingsjtu> why vpgame?
[3:33:21] <RAINFORD18> hope vgj will take 1 game
[3:33:28] <Laki82> Because the CeO of VPgame created LGD
[3:33:29] <jerjessma> B
[3:33:38] <ocean1820> I say Vgj win this series
[3:33:44] <Laki82> And also she's a woman
[3:33:45] <Philliphus> witch doctor -.-
[3:33:50] <+yakri> Terrorblade is a disgusting hero
[3:33:52] <Laki82> Newbee is also sponsored by VPgame
[3:33:52] <Philliphus> they got no lockdown for panda
[3:34:03] <EternalTensai> i say vg.j throw the series
[3:34:07] <asmith130> terrorblade=great hero :) :)
[3:34:12] <ocean1820> 2:1 VGJ wins
[3:34:13] <Laki82> Iam surprised that gyro is still not banned
[3:34:18] <Laki82> Or picked against panda
[3:34:30] <yellingsjtu> is vp sonsored by vogame?
[3:34:35] <Philliphus> void is hard to play vs distruptor
[3:34:40] <Laki82> VP is not
[3:34:41] <eLDeath_> cmonBruh
[3:34:42] <cafepuro> ye
[3:34:50] <Laki82> VPgame sponsors only chinese teams
[3:34:53] <asmith130> naga carry :)
[3:34:54] <eLDeath_> @clothe_ PunOko 👉🚪
[3:34:56] <LawdJaraxxus> void no good
[3:35:00] <ocean1820> Void =loss
[3:35:01] <Philliphus> void wolb be perfect if they didnt had distruptor
[3:35:09] <strainer_> lifestealer good
[3:35:14] <strainer_> can rage
[3:35:16] <Nickapow> @asmith130 it's not gonna be a naga carry xD
[3:35:16] <Philliphus> TAKE NAIX
[3:35:19] <LawdJaraxxus> gyro
[3:35:22] <LawdJaraxxus> is the pick
[3:35:23] <strainer_> lifestealer
[3:35:28] <Laki82> Gyro's good against brew, but it doesn't work well with naga
[3:35:28] <asmith130> pepehands
[3:35:31] <Laki82> And they need a tanky core
[3:35:31] <Philliphus> like i said
[3:35:32] <ocean1820> Vgj already won the draft
[3:35:33] <lovecito2017> Od +Omni ez counter
[3:35:34] <Laki82> Like naix
[3:35:36] <Laki82> And there he is
[3:35:37] <strainer_> DAMN IM A GOOD ANALYSIS
[3:35:41] <Philliphus> :D looool hahahah i said it!
[3:35:41] <@Moobot> Mad Enough? bit.ly/epicmad
[3:35:53] <strainer_> I said it too :(
[3:35:53] <asmith130> should have been naga carry

[3:36:58] <lultwitchlul> LGD 0 lockdown PepeHands
[3:37:00] <zrad> Vgj will win
[3:37:00] <Philliphus> VGJ got beter draft, but if lgd starts snowballing its over for VGJ
[3:37:02] <amo3b4> im only watching chinese dota
[3:37:08] <Philliphus> they got no lockdown for panda
