[0:14:32] <dairo11> god i love morphling
[0:14:56] <Cherryvv> vg lost that fight because both disables were killed at the start
[0:15:05] <devmalla> @Cherryvv they are not chinese to know all correct pronunciations
[0:15:40] <Cherryvv> those 2 players are not using chinese names...
[0:15:40] <@Moobot> Be positive, chat :)
[0:15:50] <dairo11> nice
[0:15:59] <Cherryvv> and it's just disrespectful to not pronounce a player's name correctly

[0:16:21] <popcornyellow> aussie pronunciation
[0:16:34] <wilierevillame> ez throw wp vg love u
[0:16:51] <dairo11> dude this morph is strong, they can lose
[0:17:01] <devmalla> its their gametags and pronunciations differ with accent so no disrespect, its enough for us to understand which player they talking about
[0:17:23] <dairo11> omg who cares
[0:17:40] <dairo11> ok gg
[0:17:53] <dairo11> about some stupid chinese names
[0:18:57] <dairo11> orchid was clutch on pl
[0:19:09] <Cherryvv> they had 3 silences on their team
[0:19:14] <dairo11> great item choice
[0:19:31] <Cherryvv> ori got an early solar crest too
[0:19:40] <rodoretro> Iâ€™m glad that you are casting again MLP
[0:20:06] <Cherryvv> i agree that rock threw away their chance at winning by getting linkens on morph instead of bkb earlier
[0:20:23] <Cherryvv> so many disables and silences on vg you need bkb early

[0:36:51] <dairo11> yah dota is dead, i quit playing months ago, but enjoy watching pro dota

[0:37:03] <WooDy3887> Rock y no damage at all
[0:37:08] <dairo11> it deserves to die though honestly, its just not good anymore, so many feeders and just its bad
[0:37:33] <dmf2017> To much mad people :D
[0:37:37] <sincostag> =)) i think it is still fun
[0:37:41] <shynnblue> All good things come to an end..
[0:37:46] <sincostag> and i enjoy it
[0:38:00] <dmf2017> sincostag good for you homie
[0:38:08] <dairo11> you enjoy 5 carries every game? People fighting over mid and if not getting it feeding?
[0:38:08] <sincostag> i still buy compedium for ti 8
[0:38:22] <Vaskovaskovasko> if rock can win a game
[0:38:24] <Vaskovaskovasko> its this one
[0:38:30] <sincostag> it's enough
[0:38:48] <Vaskovaskovasko> too much iffy heroes on vici
[0:38:50] <KyaaAMoy> GO GO GO GO GO GO
[0:38:51] <Vaskovaskovasko> typical game 2
[0:38:53] <OpusOvis> Guys some 3k's don't play dota anymore D E A D G A M E
[0:38:56] <Vaskovaskovasko> after won a game 1
[0:39:04] <BlueBubblePenguin> AYO TriHard
[0:39:09] <dairo11> you cant deny the numbers, it is dying
[0:39:11] <+Jungle_People> also as you get older (and wiser|) you realize spending hours everyday playing something that isn't very rewarding and requires dedication when you're not trying to go pro.. just not worth
[0:39:21] <KyaaAMoy> smoke LUL
[0:39:25] <sincostag> :)) yes
[0:39:27] <shynnblue> Nah I don't think radiance can win this.. though it's a slight outdraft if both team are as good
[0:39:34] <sincostag> i think it is right
[0:39:34] <shynnblue> Radiant *
[0:39:36] <Vaskovaskovasko> or you grow old and realize
[0:39:41] <Vaskovaskovasko> that you should spend ur time being happy
[0:39:43] <dairo11> yup agree, rather play a game of pubg or fortnite, not and hour with stupid kids yelling
[0:39:43] <Vaskovaskovasko> playing dota
[0:39:53] <Vaskovaskovasko> and not dealing with kids and responsibilities and stuff that makes u sad
[0:40:08] <sincostag> u should teach ur kids to play doto
[0:40:20] <Vaskovaskovasko> ofc I will
[0:40:20] <@Moobot> Mad Enough? bit.ly/epicmad
[0:40:22] <sincostag> and when u reitred, they will continue playing
[0:40:24] <dairo11> i get enjoyment out of watching, and seeing how the game evolves now
[0:40:25] <Vaskovaskovasko> win TI at 16
[0:40:29] <Vaskovaskovasko> assured for life
[0:41:17] <dairo11> the prize pools are way too big as well, eg dodging tourneys cause 150k is small time. that really ended dota for me, the greed
[0:41:37] <shynnblue> Lol win TI at 16
[0:41:55] <shynnblue> Is like saying win the lottery at 5. Assured for life
[0:42:26] <dairo11> play the stock market like a normal person, that is fun
[0:42:32] <dairo11> love the stock market
[0:43:04] <Vaskovaskovasko> its not the greed
[0:43:09] <Vaskovaskovasko> think about it this way
[0:43:15] <Vaskovaskovasko> its more space for other teams to come up
[0:43:17] <Vaskovaskovasko> and show skill
[0:43:21] <Vaskovaskovasko> so its better
[0:43:37] <Velatix> @dairo11 dont rag on players if they dont want to play minor tournies
[0:43:54] <dairo11> no, dota is enjoyment, period. it is their job to perform. these dumb "pros" have no idea what that means, and they deserve the game to die and work a real damn job.
[0:43:55] <Velatix> its the same as musicians or other artists
[0:44:06] <Velatix> lmao
[0:44:08] <dairo11> maybe 150k will matter then
[0:44:12] <shynnblue> It's not greed they are just prioritising
[0:44:18] <Vaskovaskovasko> hah ur saying its enjoyment, period
[0:44:21] <Velatix> dude playing dota as a pro is way harder than most jobs
[0:44:25] <Vaskovaskovasko> than you say its THEIR JOB TO PERFORM
[0:44:28] <Velatix> imagine being on the road non stop
[0:44:29] <shynnblue> If there's no other tourneys sure they will play the minor
[0:44:52] <dairo11> go say "I dont want to do that, the customer isn't paying enough" and see how he reacts
[0:44:52] <@Moobot> Our social media: http://epicenter.gg/ | http://facebook.com/epicentergg | https://twitter.com/epicentergg
[0:44:54] <Vaskovaskovasko> also tournies require qualifiers
[0:44:58] <dairo11> to your boss
[0:45:02] <Velatix> the mental stress of playing dota professionally is insane
[0:45:05] <Vaskovaskovasko> so its not jut the time u spend playing 5 mathces
[0:45:14] <Velatix> most sports players have to AT MOST play 5 games a week
[0:45:16] <Matimioh> could you imagine not getting a paycheck because you fed your lane lost your game?
[0:45:27] <Vaskovaskovasko> well ofc
[0:45:27] <@Moobot> Be positive, chat :)
[0:45:30] <Velatix> dota players have to play atleast 3x 1hour games a day
[0:45:31] <Vaskovaskovasko> its the same as
[0:45:32] <@BkopCasting> they play way more than 5 too
[0:45:33] <Vaskovaskovasko> a patient dies
[0:45:35] <Vaskovaskovasko> on a table
[0:45:37] <dolomc808> The amount of time required to be and maintain a pro level is absurd and the reality is only a small percentage are actually making real money
[0:45:41] <Vaskovaskovasko> itsa job bro
[0:45:47] <NeChanDota> herald twitch chat discussing pro dota LUL
[0:45:57] <Hyteg> @Matimioh synderen would have 0 paychecks if that were the case 4Head even if they win everything
[0:46:03] <ong9najib> LUL
[0:46:09] <shynnblue> Comparing competitive sports with normal jobs.. how shallow can u guys be lol. Obviously in competitive scene rewards are proportional to performance
[0:46:10] <dairo11> nechandota still 18 years old and understands everything
[0:46:27] <Velatix> @NeChanDota I've done international tours as a DJ
[0:46:32] <Hyteg> i thought there was a wisp in the game NotLikeThis
[0:46:37] <Velatix> i know what it's like to be on the road for months at a time
[0:47:05] <dairo11> absurd, do casters complain when they have to fly out to every tourney more than players? NO, cause its THEIR JOB
[0:47:16] <Velatix> actually they do lmaoooooooo
[0:47:22] <dairo11> you guys need to get a clue and wake up and stop defending these children who have no grasp on reality. let them work
[0:47:23] <OpusOvis> Guys dairo is 11 you have to forgive him
[0:47:23] <dolomc808> What is even the point of this conversation Iâ€™m so confused
[0:47:25] <@BkopCasting> we aren't under nearly as much stress
[0:47:44] <Hyteg> everyone's getting baited so hard Jebaited
[0:47:44] <Velatix> read an interview with redeye @dairo11
[0:47:48] <codeXgamer777> @dairo11 FailFish
[0:47:53] <dairo11> stress, give me a break
[0:48:09] <dolomc808> Troll confirmed
[0:48:21] <Hyteg> @dairo11 why do you need a break, are you stressed out? LUL
[0:48:21] <NeChanDota> it could be management's decision to not take part in minors, why are you putting all blame on players
[0:48:23] <Velatix> yeh this has to be a troll
[0:48:35] <codeXgamer777> he's not a troll FailFish he's legit FailFish
[0:48:35] <Bobond> I'm so stressed watching this game
[0:48:38] <OpusOvis> Dairo is mad because a millionaire wouldn't work at mcdonalds or something
[0:48:45] <NeChanDota> players cant say anything if their management tells them to skip some tournament
[0:49:05] <shynnblue> Yea u can't really compare different jobs with being a competitor. If u even do such comparisons then u shouldn't compete in the first place cuz u just doing to get the most rewards out of the least effort
[0:49:31] <dairo11> yah its so stressful, try having a mortgage and a family, working on commission
[0:49:54] <dairo11> kids
[0:49:55] <Velatix> nice dude
[0:49:59] <Velatix> that was your decision
[0:50:08] <OpusOvis> dairo11: "Its so stressful to do these things that I put myself into"
[0:50:12] <Velatix> live with it
[0:50:13] <dairo11> what im saying is open your eyes and look at the real world
[0:50:25] <Velatix> lmao
[0:50:34] <dairo11> defending "pros" who cant fly 5 hours to play for 150k tourney is stress
[0:50:34] <@Moobot> Mad Enough? bit.ly/epicmad
[0:50:45] <Velatix> u just sound like a boomer dude
[0:51:04] <OpusOvis> 150k total prize pool is what, 50k for first place?
[0:51:10] <Velatix> that's like saying "why doesn't bill gates just give everyone 100k????"
[0:51:11] <OpusOvis> that's peanuts for them
[0:51:22] <codeXgamer777> @dairo11 how about you go then..i bet it's easy for you
[0:51:42] <dairo11> thats why the prize pools need to die, they are way too high
[0:52:03] <shynnblue> Well if they afford to prioritise and skip tourneys, it just mean that they work their way there in the first place
[0:52:12] <dairo11> watch at ti this year, it wont even be 20 mil
[0:52:25] <Bobond> work OMEGALUL
[0:52:29] <OpusOvis> I can just imagine the tears in dairo's eyes as he sits on his computer at 3 am with his mortgage and family and working on commission and his starving children tugging on his pants

[0:52:53] <dmf2017> OpusOvis 3am? its 8.30am

[0:53:32] <Velatix> GMT +10 bois, we at the edge of the future
[0:53:55] <Hyteg> GMT+1 is where civilization is at
[0:54:10] <codeXgamer777> those prizepools are high for a reason..why would a company bankrupt itself
[0:54:15] <shynnblue> Small world craft 3 mod lol. Guess what most popular sports in Olympics nowadays probably started with a 5 year old kid playing with a small rubber ball in his basement
[0:54:16] <Velatix> imagine living 9 hours in the past LUL
[0:54:33] <Velatix> that was the point shynn

[0:55:12] <@Moobot> Our social media: http://epicenter.gg/ | http://facebook.com/epicentergg | https://twitter.com/epicentergg
[0:55:21] <OpusOvis> doesn't plus take the place of compendiums etc
[0:55:34] <Hyteg> they say there's still gonna be a compendium

[0:55:46] <CiobyKpK1> I'm sure Gabe

[0:56:46] <Hyteg> isn't gabe a multi billionaire?
[0:57:03] <Velatix> gabe is one of the richest guys in america lol
[0:57:06] <shynnblue> That's his networth
[0:57:13] <Hyteg> 20 million to him is like one of us dropping a tenner LUL
[0:57:18] <shynnblue> I'm sure he doesn't have a billion liquid asset
[0:58:04] <dairo11> yah he does
[0:58:26] <Velatix> its money master dairo
[0:58:28] <Hyteg> dairo are you just going against everything that's said here in chat?
[0:58:32] <dairo11> steam isnt even a stock, he needs no money and nobody to tell him how to run it
[0:58:37] <CiobyKpK1> People calling dota a dead game, go watch your LoL then, stolen game, stolen heroes from actual playerbase of dota 1. Much more viewers, 10 times smaller prize pools, explains it all about the owners of the game & their playerbase.
[0:59:26] <shynnblue> I don't think LoL has a bigger prize pool despite bigger playerbase fanbase and viewerbase
[0:59:37] <dairo11> exactly, and lol should
[0:59:44] <dairo11> its absurd and will change soon
[0:59:53] <Velatix> shynn m8 u need to read
[0:59:59] <Kaus3914> garena is just poor LUL
[1:00:19] <Hyteg> @CiobyKpK1 you say that, but LoL is just structured like a normal game with greedy execs, like FIFA. bigger salaries, more consistent leagues, smaller prize pools, no crowdfunding. DotA is the outlier, but it's just better and more fun in every way
[1:00:27] <codeXgamer777> LoL should wat?
[1:00:29] <Velatix> you should email gabe with some financial advice, mortgage boi

[1:01:32] <Cammerz> I enjoy fifa i just play for free. people who spend hundreds of dollarsblows my mind
[1:01:46] <shynnblue> Well playerbase is everything tho and how active the game is. Why would we care how much money the TOP 5 people are getting yearly from TI
[1:01:52] <dairo11> hundreds on what?
[1:02:12] <Cammerz> fifa points and ingame money
[1:02:17] <dairo11> soccer game?
[1:02:25] <Cammerz> yea
[1:02:33] <dairo11> oh, well its only the most popular sport in the world
[1:02:45] <Hyteg> baby boomer doesn't know fifa; NA confirmed LUL
[1:02:47] <shynnblue> Like out of the 500k people playing the game we care about how much the TOP 5 person earns instead of just the fact they did really well
[1:02:55] <dairo11> i mean look at arcana, heck i even bought a tb one and a nice lycan set and i quit... wonder if i can sell them somehow
[1:03:51] <Velatix> @dairo11 yeh the bank will take them off your hands when you fail to pay your mortgage
