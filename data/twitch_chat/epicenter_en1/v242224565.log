[3:35:49] <PatisauR> if ana goes back on OG will OG win majors again?
[3:35:50] <gayl0rd3000> @PatisauR I think Ana can't even save OG
[3:35:51] <gradecurve> bring back the old fire blast, so we can have pub-hell bloodstone ogre mid again
[3:35:54] <InSpectre_X> @akanisenpar it was never top meta for sure, but there were a few good players, black^ played him semi frequently for a bit too
[3:35:58] <+akanisenpar> @InSpectre_X He played it more when he was on Empire. I wouldn't exactly call it a meta pick though. More like a pocket strat.

[6:04:04] <ThePrinceofcats> This music hurts!!!
[6:04:05] <@Danrulio> think they lost players to other rosters so they only have 3

[6:20:38] <arima322> sooo long match fixing so hard
[6:20:43] <Senotchka> @slashershot its more of a soap opera nowadays than real sports

[6:20:58] <SeaBreeze_> @GranDGranT How many monsters are powering you up right now
[6:21:14] <slashershot> @senothcka in comparison with other sectors of the economy in portugal and the world in general. u dont hear EPL having rigged betting
[6:21:16] <Senotchka> @slashershot indeed it is but its a good example of how corruption gets everywhere when theres money involved

[6:21:45] <kamilrawk_> !song
[6:21:45] <straba83> is it zardoniac or something?
[6:21:52] <rinzinc> manipulating bet in sports in higher competition is very rare n once u r caught then ur billion dollar sports club goes down the drain...they dont have to dirty there hand with betting money,,they make more them enough through sale n advertising

[6:26:39] <kotuvuong> Political chat PogChamp
[6:26:47] <aybaann> no game 3?
[6:26:49] <Senotchka> @rinzinc i know that very well been hit by it many times
[6:26:49] <+adrianIban> xd
[6:26:52] <Noobjkburning> they r fixing so delay
[6:26:58] <slashershot> @senothcka the cloning pcs? a virtual image for tournament use only
[6:27:07] <mrbulldog090> When will it start?
[6:27:18] <+mikedrunkbeater1> @rinzinc who is bowing down?
[6:27:21] <slashershot> @senothcka if u meant corruption, i'm against it but theres nothing i can do about it LUL
[6:27:24] <Senotchka> @slashershot why does it matter? what if i told u people can cheat anyway without a single periferical?
[6:27:30] <@Danrulio> @slashershot most LAN settings use that setup
[6:27:43] <slashershot> @senothcka for the technical issues thingy FailFish
[6:27:44] <MazenKayed1994> how much time left for game 3 to start?
[6:27:49] <+mikedrunkbeater1> some dude randomly gets timed out monkaS
[6:27:50] <sakiwatanabe123> my boy grandgrant is gonna die
[6:27:51] <rinzinc> @senothcka i have met so many doctor n engineer who dont have good paying job coz they cant pay the require fee(corruption) tothe higher up
[6:27:53] <kylamia123> wtf is wrong @Danrulio
[6:27:57] <@GranDGranT> i mean i just dont undertstand
[6:28:00] <Senotchka> @slashershot mate techicall issues happen anyway
[6:28:02] <slashershot> @Danrulio could u shed some light on what happens in tournaments? like if u are cloning from a virtual image why are there technical issues
[6:28:04] <soloque> @MazenKayed1994 nobody knows
[6:28:04] <@GranDGranT> Dont they have a infrastructure in china
[6:28:05] <+mikedrunkbeater1> grant won't cast 3
[6:28:13] <slashershot> they sure do
[6:28:13] <+mikedrunkbeater1> like roads?
[6:28:27] <slashershot> china actually has better infra than the us for internet :\ thats why this is weird
[6:28:37] <sakiwatanabe123> just toss a coin to decide who wins game 3 4Head
[6:28:56] <edwrr> ResidentSleeper
[6:28:58] <straba83> corruption isnt punished enough, if there was death sentence for it, it would look different
[6:28:58] <+mikedrunkbeater1> both teams are in the same team house LUL
[6:28:59] <rinzinc> TBH its super easy to throw in game of dota if u think....BB n go rambo next time n its GG..no one suspect u
[6:29:04] <soloque> Is this an internet issue ?
[6:29:17] <@Danrulio> @slashershot I'm not an admin, just twitch mod. PCs are complicated tho, sometimes a supplier who's had no troubles gives you a bad batch of PCs or something and now you've got troubles all event
[6:29:23] <Noobjkburning> plz extend 10 min so i cancel my bet
[6:29:24] <+mikedrunkbeater1> otherwise death match between sylar and lanm LUL
[6:29:41] <@Moobot> Our social media: http://epicenter.gg/ | http://facebook.com/epicentergg | https://twitter.com/epicentergg
[6:29:44] <soloque> @straba83 sure kill someone for making a few bucks illegally
[6:29:56] <slashershot> @Danrulio i think thats true. as in the suppliers gave a bad batch and the head guy didnt give enough time to test
[6:30:05] <Senotchka> @straba83 other places, like portugal, just watch politicians being corrupt and let it be . leel clowns
[6:30:20] <@Danrulio> @slashershot or maybe you test the PCs in the studio and they all work fine, but when you move to the stadium for playoffs something is set up wrong or something happened to the PCs in transit
[6:30:20] <czederanian> Yoo
[6:30:28] <MazenKayed1994> 7 minutes for the game to start or what?
[6:30:42] <rinzinc> china always have this lag issue or prob while broadcating internationally
[6:30:46] <Thunderfire123> Fnatic
[6:30:53] <czederanian> Fnatic is struggling right now
[6:30:55] <+adrianIban> type 1 if you think you will die before game 3 starts
[6:30:56] <Noobjkburning> ez for nb
[6:30:57] <+adrianIban> 1
[6:30:59] <@GranDGranT> had 10 players, tried starting game twice
[6:31:00] <@Moobot> Mad Enough? bit.ly/epicmad
[6:31:01] <@GranDGranT> didnt load
[6:31:02] <Noobjkburning> 1
[6:31:03] <@GranDGranT> And now 1 player is gone
[6:31:04] <slashershot> @Danrulio thats what i find interesting, moving pc configurations is a solved problem in devops.
[6:31:09] <czederanian> Even liquid beat them without miracle
[6:31:15] <@Danrulio> @slashershot esports events are complicated because there aren't really purpose built esports stadiums; you have tournament organisers having to source everything on a per-event basis & do all their setup and testing in a very short timeframe
[6:31:17] <czederanian> But they won in vg
[6:31:18] <czederanian> Yes
[6:31:20] <slashershot> 10 players 10 players game starts twice now 9 players remains
[6:31:22] <Arctism> this delay is amazing XD
[6:31:26] <czederanian> I think newbie will pull this off
[6:31:29] <+Corgigoro> The chinese servers are so good! :)
[6:31:33] <slashershot> @Danrulio with limited budget too?
[6:31:39] <+mikedrunkbeater1> Game Coordinator is down. GabeN is doing a ritualsacrifice to bring it back up LUL
[6:31:47] <kamilrawk_> chinese doto LUL delay doto LUL
[6:31:47] <slashershot> hire 6 interns. feelsbadman
[6:31:54] <@Danrulio> @slashershot LANs are quite expensive to put on yeah, but I couldn't give you any particular insight on how its budgeted
[6:31:55] <czederanian> Lol
[6:31:56] <BrenoSarkis> songname please
[6:32:01] <+Corgigoro> Honestly all these esports tournaments trying to book stadiums is foolish
[6:32:09] <+mikedrunkbeater1> interns are hired for ritual sacrifice LUL
[6:32:12] <soloque> Lord Gaben is displeased
[6:32:12] <gookleader> @Danrulio you reckon they should organize dota like overwatch
[6:32:12] <NoRetribution> @Danrulio I don't know if you are the right person to say this to but with the game taking this long I'm going to be switching to another stream hope you this can be fixed for next time
[6:32:21] <+Corgigoro> Just book a large conference hall for a quarter of the price damn
[6:32:22] <straba83> KappaPride music
[6:32:24] <Mitnavnerjohn> when is next game?
[6:32:37] <slashershot> @Danrulio yeah. i'm actually interested in the deployment at scale and why are there issues. I mean real companies deploy 100s at a time
[6:32:44] <@Danrulio> @gookleader the OWL/LCS model of doing things makes it way easier to organise, but isn't really viable with the way the open circuits of Dota/CSGO work
[6:32:47] <NUDIE6> wheres game 3 ?
[6:32:51] <Mystic_Freeze> ResidentSleeper
[6:32:56] <NUDIE6> halo ?
[6:32:59] <@Danrulio> @NoRetribution i'm just a twitch mod dude, switch away
[6:33:00] <slashershot> game 3 is a coin flip
