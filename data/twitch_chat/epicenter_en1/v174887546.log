[1:24:14] <barisbakrc> 14-1 confirmed half xD
[1:24:20] <Blackflunk> Well yeah but VP has always been known as the team not to bet on because they're unrelieable as fuck, but North do have experienced players like MSL and CajunB, this team has nothing.
[1:24:21] <csgomalen> How did he not see him?
[1:24:45] <magn1201> 16-1 hltv confirmed 4Head 4Head
[1:25:12] <lazeb> @Blackflunk And north has proven to be able to contest for the 1st place in EVERY single tournament this year, unlike VP has always gone out of groups, or lucky semi final finish
[1:25:17] <mikkelsson1> 16-13 hltv confirmed
[1:25:31] <csgomalen> @Blackflunk Agreed. VP is unreliable, at times.

[1:26:49] <5Klayy> game 3 who will win?
[1:27:02] <Hashslingingslasher_hd> does avangar only have cache in their country?
[1:27:04] <Junly1991> Avangar win
[1:27:04] <+khal_hotpie> who choose this map?
[1:27:04] <lazeb> @BombardianKing Flipside is kinda average on mirage, they mostly rely on worldedit to hold mid window with awp, and as this game goes, worldedit is playing very bad, Mirage is 2nd best map for Avangar after cache. So it could be 2-1 Avangar winning
[1:27:08] <Jorsid123> Avangar 5Klayy xD
[1:27:11] <aitd1> @luke_bellew sure.. of course not Kappa
[1:27:11] <Blackflunk> @Diamondmystery I think you're not looking at VP in the old days, VP did shine at one point but they would never lose to teams like this crap.
