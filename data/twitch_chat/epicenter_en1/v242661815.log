[1:59:55] <cmountainsnake> Will IG return in TI8? Theyre my fav Chinese team
[2:00:02] <atlaswakes> @cammerz hope so
[2:00:08] <roll1ng1> vgj choked bigtime vs secret.. 2-0 up and giant networth in game3 and went on to lose LUL
[2:00:31] <atlaswakes> @roll1ng1 u mean vg?
[2:00:38] <Me4onyX> @cmountainsnake ig got destroyed by lgd earlier
[2:00:40] <aberrantbear> VP gonna win ti8,.
[2:00:46] <aceking198> @roll1ng1 that was vg = vici gaming
[2:00:46] <@Moobot> Our social media: http://epicenter.gg/ | http://facebook.com/epicentergg | https://twitter.com/epicentergg
[2:00:49] <atlaswakes> yeah that series was a big choke
[2:00:50] <roll1ng1> oh ya my bad LUL BrokeBack
[2:01:06] <roll1ng1> too many vg teams lol
[2:01:13] <atlaswakes> it was game 4 they threw. against liquid they threw a 2-0 lead LUL
[2:01:25] <aceking198> Both VG squads normally PogChamp Both VG squads in Finals LUL
[2:01:33] <aberrantbear> Is secret still good or fnatic can beat them?
[2:01:46] <roll1ng1> secret 3-0 e i think
[2:01:48] <cmountainsnake> @me4onyx Really? Why do I always miss them? Maybe a timezone thing...
[2:01:52] <roll1ng1> ez*
[2:01:55] <slashershot> 3-1 probably
[2:02:00] <atlaswakes> vg organization have 6 2nd places so far
[2:02:03] <slashershot> Ace beats EE
[2:02:06] <skynthyb225> no mEErcy for secrekt
[2:02:08] <atlaswakes> new c9
[2:02:14] <+akanisenpar> @aberrantbear Secret are rising back up. Hard to judge how strong they are rn without any real competition at Dreamleague.
[2:02:21] <slashershot> izint newbee the china c9
[2:02:26] <Darkest_Daryl> EE fans LUL
[2:02:27] <aceking198> @aberrantbear I would say secret has the advantage but fnatic could pull something off
[2:02:30] <slashershot> oh wait that time has passed LUL
[2:02:39] <slashershot> waiting for fnatic broodmother LUL
[2:02:39] <puncher_of_kittens> 3rd game VGJ got this
[2:02:44] <slashershot> EE played one game and never touched it again
[2:02:44] <@Moobot> Be positive, chat :)
[2:02:47] <aberrantbear> lol 30 mins before game comes back
[2:02:51] <joehawks12> i wanna believe in EE's drafting. he's been ramping it up, and uni's perfect game yesterday had me hyped
[2:02:52] <finakisberg> :)
[2:02:53] <roll1ng1> vgj so tilted now no chance
[2:02:55] <atlaswakes> nah newbee dont get that many 2nd places. they are very inconsistent tjough
[2:02:57] <aberrantbear> I wonder if I should keep on betting LGD
[2:03:07] <atlaswakes> @aberrantbear yeah do it
[2:03:14] <slashershot> @atlaswakes I KNOW RIGHT the top team with the most variance LUL
[2:03:29] <slashershot> they take series off the other top teams but lose some games to tier 3 teams LUL
[2:03:29] <aceking198> @atlaswakes in Newbee defense both secret and fnatic have looked top tier lately
[2:03:32] <CuddlyWuddly> yeah, uni played crazy good
[2:03:38] <+akanisenpar> EE isn't gonna win a draft against Puppey. Puppey knows EE's shenanigans.
[2:03:43] <+Apu2k> I caint luv yu
[2:03:50] <slashershot> no he doesnt
[2:03:54] <1puls1> LGD is tier 5
[2:03:55] <slashershot> even EE doesnt know EE shenanigans
[2:04:02] <joehawks12> ^^
[2:04:05] <humanperson34> fnatic's the most interesting team atm
[2:04:08] <roll1ng1> puppey vs EE battle for 10% LUL
[2:04:15] <finakisberg> MrDestructoid auto input at pleasing levels MrDestructoid
[2:04:15] <slashershot> he might decide that riki carry is the new op stuff
[2:04:17] <Adamg0ill1> Secret destroyed yesterdat
[2:04:25] <slashershot> its not fnatic. any team EE goes to becomes interesting
[2:04:27] <teddyzai> anymore game after this ?
[2:04:28] <+akanisenpar> Even better. Puppey and EE can both outdraft EE then.
[2:04:34] <slashershot> the storyline literally follows him
[2:04:42] <aceking198> EE beat secret when they were a far weaker team even if secret let their guard down as a far stronger team not a guaranteed win but they do have a much bette chance
[2:04:45] <ShouldersOfGiants222> EE is prob the most interesting player, period
[2:04:49] <aberrantbear> is LGD really that strong against VGJ lol
[2:04:52] <puncher_of_kittens> so guys
[2:05:00] <ShouldersOfGiants222> dude's a paradox of the highest order
[2:05:01] <puncher_of_kittens> secret fnatic
[2:05:04] <joehawks12> north american, and doesn't speak a lick of english. interesting indeed
[2:05:08] <puncher_of_kittens> secret honestly not looking very good
[2:05:11] <puncher_of_kittens> fnatic looking better
[2:05:14] <humanperson34> which team was EE in previously
[2:05:17] <Adamg0ill1> Doubt it
[2:05:23] <slashershot> and yet secret got in from the winner's bracket finals :
[2:05:24] <ShouldersOfGiants222> if you're a complete idiot, you think EE is bad. All the best players In the world acknowledge EE as a great player and dota mind
[2:05:37] <aceking198> @aberrantbear LGD used to lose to vgj all the time they have become much better now though
[2:05:40] <slashershot> C9
[2:05:51] <roll1ng1> c9 curse will always stick with EE they will never in anything.. but they are fun to watch
[2:05:56] <slashershot> clown 9 unite Kreygasm
[2:06:03] <roll1ng1> never win*
[2:06:04] <lordanz37> after gg call all lgd player quit game very fast
[2:06:07] <rtz_is_my_b1tch3s> secret are back on form lol if you watch dreamleague they crushed newbee and liquid. but fnatic are doing great too! it will be a good finals
[2:06:08] <Adamg0ill1> What happened to cloud 9 dota?
[2:06:11] <Me4onyX> vgj logo is blue and white. coinsidence? i think not
[2:06:16] <Darkest_Daryl> @shouldersofgiants222 Jebaited
[2:06:17] <lordanz37> lgd wanna end fast this qualification
[2:06:18] <Me4onyX> chinese c9 confirmed
[2:06:23] <joehawks12> idk, i think uni might be the glue EE needed
[2:06:37] <slashershot> lgd gaming paid off vgj Kappa
[2:06:40] <ShouldersOfGiants222> but i had mercy on him, he worked hard.
[2:06:43] <humanperson34> secret 2 -0 everyone... but fnatic's played more games :P
[2:06:52] <ShouldersOfGiants222> I'd feel bad in the morning if i took that away from him
[2:07:16] <ShouldersOfGiants222> pro tip - dp the right thing
[2:07:56] <aceking198> EE plz give us the first not 3-0 Finals BlessRNG
[2:07:56] <@Moobot> Mad Enough? bit.ly/epicmad
[2:08:05] <Chuan911> o
[2:08:14] <+robojosh> Get to the game I wanna see the 3-0 lol
[2:08:28] <cerulean_dota> Anyone know if the epicenter open qualis will be streamned? its kinguin vs ex-penta, and vega vs someone
[2:08:40] <slashershot> maybe check grandgrant @tenuous_copper
[2:08:41] <joehawks12> i honestly haven't been this hyped about an EE team since those fateful c9 days. i know thats not good but i can't help it. The cast around him is subarashii
[2:08:45] <slashershot> i heard it might be on this stream
[2:08:48] <aceking198> VGJ even if you lose atleast take one game off LGD BlessRNG
[2:08:53] <Darkest_Daryl> @aceking198 your wish is granted son it will be 5-0 Jebaited
[2:09:38] <slashershot> this is a best of 130
[2:09:41] <huiser001> hi?
[2:09:51] <stabillo44> LGD already win 2-0 from vgj 2 days ago
[2:09:57] <humanperson34> 130-0
[2:10:01] <VitaBellae> Hello chat :) remember to stay positive, smile and never say anything negative in epicenter chat :)
[2:10:05] <stabillo44> so this will be 3-0 SeemsGood
[2:10:25] <stalemilk94> lgd will get 2nd at epicenter obviously. the chinese teams take it in turns to get 2nd at every major
[2:10:28] <aberrantbear> 27-0
[2:11:09] <stabillo44> if ruru already said 3-0 , it will come true

[2:13:39] <ShouldersOfGiants222> they make you think they're weak
[2:13:42] <ShouldersOfGiants222> then they come on strong
[2:13:47] <ShouldersOfGiants222> they're deep in the art of war
[2:13:48] <stabillo44> ruru already said 3-0 LUL
[2:13:50] <ShouldersOfGiants222> that's china
